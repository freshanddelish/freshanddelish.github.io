The medical advice in Australia is that oats are not safe for those with coeliac disease. (I know this varies in other countries.) When I was first diagnosed my gastroenterologist explained that the reason for this is two-fold: First, oats and wheat are often grown in adjacent fields and processed on the same equipment so the risk of cross-contamination is very high. Second, oats contain a protein (called avenin) which is similar in structure to gluten and which around 1 in 5 coeliacs also react to. <a href=\"http://www.coeliac.org.au/coeliac-disease/faq.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Coeliac Australia</a> explain that there is no way to test who will react to avenin in advance, and so they actually class avenin as a type of gluten and advise that coeliacs should not eat oats. I developed this recipe the first winter after I was diagnosed with coeliac disease and it has been our regular cold-weather breakfast ever since.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/04/22/2013-4-22-pumpkin-quinoa-porridge/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pumpkin quinoa porridge","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/pumpkin-quinoa-porridge-35424da0a5394fa438ea8c992e0d9cee-c0929.jpg","srcSet":"/static/pumpkin-quinoa-porridge-35424da0a5394fa438ea8c992e0d9cee-95b0c.jpg 200w,\n/static/pumpkin-quinoa-porridge-35424da0a5394fa438ea8c992e0d9cee-46236.jpg 400w,\n/static/pumpkin-quinoa-porridge-35424da0a5394fa438ea8c992e0d9cee-c0929.jpg 800w,\n/static/pumpkin-quinoa-porridge-35424da0a5394fa438ea8c992e0d9cee-27289.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"excerpt":"<p></p>\n<p>Being a porridge, this is a lovely warm and sweet breakfast or brunch dish, but I did have it for dinner the other night when I was feeling in need of something cosy.
