Turn the capsicum during cooking so the skin blisters on all sides.

Bake until eggplant is very tender (the skin will also be slightly crinkly), about 30-40 minutes.</p>\n<p>Squeeze garlic out of its peel and into a bowl. Peel and seed capsicum, pat dry and finely dice, then add to the garlic. Peel eggplant skin away from the flesh (or if it’s not coming away easily, scoop flesh out with a metal spoon). Finely dice eggplant flesh and add to the bowl. Add the fresh basil, along with the balsamic, 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Adjust the vinegar and seasoning to taste.</p>\n<p>Serve warm or at room temperature, spooned over the baby spinach.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Roast eggplant puree","date":"May 01, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013/05/01/2013-4-28-roast-eggplant-puree/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/04/30/2013-4-18-mushroom-and-chestnut-gratin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mushroom and chestnut gratin","tags":["Dairy/lactose-free friendly","Vegan friendly","Vegetarian"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/05/08/2013-4-30-spanakopita-filled-chickpea-crepes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Spanakopita filled chickpea crepes","tags":["Appetisers","Eggs","Nut-free friendly","Vegetarian"]}}}}
