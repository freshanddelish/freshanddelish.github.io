As it turns out, we were still polishing off the left overs three days later! (Admittedly left-overs <em>are</em> almost compulsory following Christmas lunch.) In this case it definitely worked out for the best because this creation is really very good (am I allowed to say that about my own recipe?)</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Back home and through the process of testing the recipe this salad has rapidly become a favourite. Only thing is, there are two versions and I can’t decide which I like best, so I’ve included both options and you can choose for yourself. </p>\n<p>The question before you is this: pomegranate or cranberries? The pomegranate seeds are refreshing and add a nice crunch. The cranberries are sweeter and slightly chewy. I like both versions. I’d suggest the pomegranate as a nice refreshing choice on a warm day, and the cranberries when you’re looking to bring a little more sweetness to the meal. Dried cranberries are also typically easier to come by than fresh pomegranates.</p>\n<p>I haven’t included rocket in my leafy greens. Personally I don’t like rocket – I find it too hot – while the watercress here is just a little peppery. If you are a fan of rocket I suspect if would work well in this salad, and I always encourage experimentation when cooking.</p>\n<p>For a nut free version, skip the almonds. It won’t be as crunchy but the combination of flavours should still survive. For a vegan or dairy/lactose-free alternative, omit the parmesan.</p>\n<p>Serves 4 as a side</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 cups baby kale</li>\n<li>2 cups baby spinach</li>\n<li>1 cup watercress leaves, removed from stems</li>\n<li>½ cup almonds</li>\n<li>1 pomegranate or ½ cup dried cranberries</li>\n<li>½ cup shaved parmesan</li>\n<li>½ red onion, finely sliced or diced</li>\n<li><a href=\"#mustardvinaigrette\">⅓ cup mustard Vinaigrette (recipe below)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If using a pomegranate, start by seeding the fruit (otherwise, skip straight to the next paragraph).
