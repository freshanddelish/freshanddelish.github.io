<p>I tend to get a little concerned when I hear the &#8216;vegetarian&#8217;Â conversationÂ going on in the background while I&#8217;m cooking. It goes something like this:Â my partner being quizzed by our dinner guest along the lines of &#8220;so are you vegetarian too?&#8221;, &#8220;do you always eat vegetarian meals?&#8221;, &#8220;do you mind not eating meat at home?&#8221;, &#8220;what about protein?&#8221;,Â etc., etc. Fast forward an hour or two and said guest has not only complemented the meal butÂ scraped his plate clean and even volunteered to do the washing up (actions speak louder than words)&#8230;Â I think maybe I&#8217;ve changed someone&#8217;s mind on vegetarian cooking!</p>
<p>This recipe came about by combining a mango and halloumiÂ saladÂ suggestion fromÂ my good friend Tegan, with a mango and avocado saladÂ recipe fromÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-All-About-Vegetarian/dp/B0002Y0SII%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0002Y0SII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joy of Cooking: All About Vegetarian Cooking</a>Â by Irma Rombauer et al., along with some tweaks of my own. If you&#8217;ve tried my recipes before, hopefully you&#8217;ve learned that even (or especially) when you read anÂ ingredients list and the words &#8220;unlikely combination&#8221; come to mind, the result is going to be good. If you&#8217;re new to my blog then trust me, this is worth being a little adventurous!</p>
<p>I often include eggs with the salad to turn in into a complete meal, but I also like serving it without the eggs alongside panfried fish or to add a bit of &#8216;wow&#8217; factor to a spread.Â The number of eggs is also easily varied according to appetite: after something slightly lighter?Â make it 1 egg per person, feeding a hungry man after a big training session?Â pile on some extra eggs and maybe add a side with more carbs.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, skip the macadamias. For a vegan and dairy/lactose free salad, leave out the eggs and halloumiÂ and the resulting mango and avocado salad is still a great combination!</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>Â½ cup macadamia nuts</li>
<li>1 lemon, juiced (around 3 tablespoonsÂ lemon juice)</li>
<li>2 avocados</li>
<li>2 small-medium mangoes or 1 large</li>
<li>Â½ red onion</li>
<li>2 orÂ 3 tablespoons olive oil (use 3 tablespoons if you&#8217;re including eggs, otherwise just use 2)</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>Â¼ cup fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 cups baby spinach</li>
<li>8 eggs (optional)</li>
<li>200g halloumi</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 160ËšC (320 F). Coarsely chop the macadamias then spread on a baking tray. Bake in oven until macadamias are fragrant and lightly toasted. If your oven is preheated this will only take 3-5 minutes, although they may need longer if the oven&#8217;s still heating up.Â Keep a close eye on them, nuts will generally go from raw to burnt very easily if you get distracted. Once the macadamias are toasted set them aside until you&#8217;re ready to serve.</p>
<p>Place half the lemon juice in a medium-sized bowl.Â Slice the avocados lengthwise and remove the stones. Score flesh into approximately 1cm pieces then scoop it away from the skin and place in the bowl of lemon juice. Toss to coat the avocado with lemon juice &#8211;Â this will help prevent browning (which is quite harmless butÂ aesthetically not very pleasing).</p>
<p>Cut the mango(es) into approximately 1 cm pieces and add to the avocado. Peel and finely slice the red onion; add it to the mango and avocado then toss to combine.</p>
<p>Make the dressing: combine 2 tablespoon olive oil, the remaining lemon juice, finely chopped basil and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a jar and shake to combine.</p>
<p>Divide baby spinach between serving plates and spoon avocado and mango mixture over the top.</p>
<p>If serving with eggs: depending on your frying pan you may need to cook the eggs in a few batches.Â Heat the remaining tablespoon (or for batches, portion there-of)Â of olive oilÂ in a frying pan over medium heat. Keeping the medium heat, fry the eggs for a 2-3 minutes on each side until light golden and cooked through. Serve alongside the salad and season with a little salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>Finally, cook the halloumi. This is very quick so I do it last after I&#8217;ve cooked the eggs. Use the frying pan from the eggs that&#8217;s still hot, or heat your frying pan over a hot stove then turn the heat down to medium. Placing halloumi into an already hot pan will ensure it forms a delicious golden crust while melting on the insideÂ (whereas if itÂ cooks too slowly you may end up with a blob of molten cheese in your pan).Â There&#8217;s generally enough fat in the halloumi that it doesn&#8217;t need extra oil for cooking, especially if you&#8217;re using a non-stick frying pan. Cook over a medium heat for about 1 minute on each side until halloumi is golden brown then server over the salad.</p>
<p>Give the dressing you made another shake to ensure it&#8217;s well mixed then drizzle over the salad. Sprinkle with macadamia nuts and you&#8217;re good to go.

<p>Despite being fairly confident that&nbsp;there would be plenty of food&nbsp;I agreed to add an extra dish,&nbsp;opting&nbsp;for a leafy salad to complement the already substantial meal.&nbsp;As it turns out, we were still polishing off the left overs three days later!&nbsp;(Admittedly&nbsp;left-overs <em>are</em> almost compulsory following Christmas lunch.) In this case it definitely&nbsp;worked out for the best because this creation is really very good&nbsp;(am I allowed to say that about my own recipe?)</p>
<p>Back home and through the process of testing the recipe this salad&nbsp;has rapidly become a favourite. Only thing is, there are two versions and I can&#8217;t decide which I like best, so I&#8217;ve included both options and you can choose for yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question before you is this: pomegranate or cranberries? The pomegranate seeds are refreshing and add a nice crunch. The cranberries are sweeter and slightly chewy. I like both versions. I&#8217;d suggest the pomegranate&nbsp;as a nice refreshing choice&nbsp;on a&nbsp;warm day, and the cranberries when you&#8217;re looking to bring a little more sweetness to the meal. Dried cranberries are also typically easier to come by than fresh pomegranates.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px">I haven&#8217;t included rocket in my leafy greens.&nbsp;Personally I don&#8217;t like rocket&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;I find it too hot &#8211;&nbsp;while the watercress here is just a little peppery.&nbsp;If you are a fan of rocket&nbsp;I suspect if would work well in this salad, and I always encourage experimentation when cooking.</span></p>
<p>For a nut free version, skip the almonds. It won&#8217;t be as crunchy but the combination of flavours should still survive. For a vegan or dairy/lactose-free alternative, omit the parmesan.</p>
<p>Serves 4 as a side</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups baby kale</li>
<li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
<li>1 cup watercress leaves, removed from stems</li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px">Â½</span> cup almonds</li>
<li>1 pomegranate or Â½ cup dried cranberries</li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px">Â½</span> cup shaved parmesan</li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px">Â½</span> red onion, finely sliced or diced</li>
<li><a href="#"><span style="font-size:14px">â…“ cup m</span>ustard Vinaigrette (recipe below)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If using a&nbsp;pomegranate, start by seeding the fruit (otherwise, skip straight to the next paragraph). Tori&nbsp;Avey provides some great instructions explaining&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/2011/09/how-to-seed-a-pomegranate/#recipe">How to Seed a Pomegranate</a>. (Tori&#8217;s post also includes instructions for juicing a pomegranate &#8211; don&#8217;t go that far here, for this salad you want to keep the seeds whole.)</p>
<p>Place kale, spinach and&nbsp;watercress&nbsp;in a large salad bowl and toss to mix. Pour mustard vinaigrette over the top&nbsp;and toss again so the greens are well coated with&nbsp;the dressing. Add the almonds, pomegranate or cranberries, parmesan and onion. Toss to combine all ingredients and serve straight away.</p>
<p><a name="mustardvinaigrette"></a></p>
<p><strong>Mustard Vinaigrette</strong></p>
<p>Makes a little over&nbsp;â…“ cup</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:14px">Â½</span> lemon, juiced (around 1Â½ tablespoons lemon juice)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>
<li>2 teaspoons white wine vinegar</li>
<li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>pinch each of&nbsp;salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a jar,&nbsp;(ensure the lid is properly secured,)&nbsp;and shake well to combine.</p>

<p>Deliciousness in a glass! I mean seriously, who needs junk food when you can make treats like this that are made with proper&nbsp;food and contain real nutrients while also making your taste buds super happy?!</p>
<p>For vegan and dairy/lactose free alternatives, use soy or other non-dairy&nbsp;milk and either skip the yoghurt or try replacing it with silken tofu or non-dairy yoghurt.</p>
<p>Serves 1</p>
<ul>
<li>1 banana, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
<li>Â¼ cup skim milk</li>
<li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
<li>2 tablespoons natural yoghurt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cocoa powder</li>
<li>Â½ cup ice blocks (adjust depending on how cold you&#8217;d like your smoothie, alternatively use frozen banana and skip the ice).</li>

<p>Hello&nbsp;and welcome to the latest episode of &#8216;What&#8217;s Left in the Fridge at the End of the Week?&#8217; And the answer is: carrots, chestnuts, a bunch of silverbeet and some lemons. The lemons are still in the fridge, everything else went into this surprisingly successful creation that I&#8217;ll definitely be making again.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped or crushed</li>
<li>6 sprigs thyme</li>
<li>6 sage leaves, finely chopped</li>
<li>1/4 tsp cumin seeds</li>
<li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
<li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>2 bunches carrots</li>
<li>500g chestnuts</li>
<li><span>Â½</span>&nbsp;cup parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 red onion, finely diced</li>
<li>Large bunch silverbeet</li>
<li>1 cup cashews, roasted</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350F).</p>
<p>Place cumin seeds in a skillet and cook over a low heat until they become fragrant. Don&#8217;t leave them unattended for long because they&#8217;ll quickly go from lightly toasted to burnt; I&#8217;d suggest removing the seeds from the heat when their scent becomes stronger, rather than waiting for them to appear brown.</p>
<p>Remove leaves from thyme and discard the stems. In a small bowl combine the thyme and sage leaves, garlic, cumin seeds, honey, sherry, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Cut the carrots into sticks approximately 1 cm (Â½ &nbsp;inch) thick and toss through the spiced oil you just mixed up. Spread in a baking dish&nbsp;and bake until just tender, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile roast and peel the chestnuts: Use a Stanley knife to cut a slice through the top (the pointy&nbsp;end) of each chestnut. Place on a tray and bake for 15-20 minutes until the skin starts to look a little crinkly or to split. Remove only a cup or so of&nbsp;chestnuts from the oven at a time as they&#8217;re easiest to peel while still quite hot. Peel the outer shell and inner skin from each chestnut.&nbsp;I wear a rubber glove on one hand but leave the other free as a balance between not getting burnt and maintaining a degree of dexterity.</p>
<p>Add chestnuts to the dish roasted carrots along with parsley and red onion. Toss to combine then return to the oven for about 5 minutes while you prepare the silverbeet.</p>
<p>Remove the stems from the silverbeet and coarsely chop the leaves. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the silverbeet and toss to coat with&nbsp;the oil. Cook, stirring frequently,&nbsp;until just wilted (if the oil is already hot this will only take a minute or two).&nbsp;Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re ready to serve: Divide the silverbeet between plates or bowls. Top with&nbsp;carrots and chestnuts and sprinkle with roasted cashews.</p>
<ul></ul>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span>DOES NOT CONTAIN FROG</p>
<p>This snack idea is so simple I almost didn&#8217;t post it; doing so feels a bit like writing a recipe for a cup of tea. However, I&#8217;ve had at least five people ask me about this concoction in the space of a week so here it is.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I particularly like chia prepared this way because it&#8217;s an energy source that&#8217;s light enough that I can drink it then proceed to exercise 15 minutes later without feeling remotely ill &#8211; even if that exercise is teaching Body Attack with it&#8217;s tuck-jump-burpees. There are not many foods for which I can say the same.</p>
<p>Now for the credits: idea courtesy of my sister, and the name&#8230; inspired by my mother who came close to convincing her squad of swimmers,&nbsp;using post-exercise nutritional arguments,&nbsp;that she was in fact drinking frogs eggs!</p>
<p>Serves 1</p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons chia seeds (any colour)</li>
<li>juice of half a lemon or lime (if you like stronger citrus flavours, add juice from the whole fruit)</li>
<li>300mL water</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a jar. Secure lid and shake well. Shake a couple of times over the next 5-10 minutes so the chia doesn&#8217;t clump together too densely. Refrigerate or allow to sit for at least 30 minutes and you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>It is possible to overdose on parsley? This is the question my partner&#8217;s been asking as he shares his suspicions that I&#8217;m trying to poison him with the herb, we&#8217;ve been eating that much of it lately! No, I don&#8217;t have a weird parsley obsession or craving (and I most certainly am not trying to poison anyone), we just have two parsley plants that are on a mission to take over the world, starting with our veggie garden. In a battle that&#8217;s been ongoing for several months now, I&#8217;m starting to get the upper hand, in large part thanks to regular batches of <a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2014/7/27/stuffed-capsicums-with-parsley-pesto#parsleypesto">parsley pesto</a>.</p>
<p>I was quite proud of these <a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2014/7/27/stuffed-capsicums-with-parsley-pesto#stuffedcapsicums">stuffed capsicums</a> because they centred around ingredients picked fresh from our garden: the parsley, of course, and also the sage and this delightful harvest of capsicums:</p>
<p>      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Capsicumparselyharvest1editedresized.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Enjoy these stuffed capsicums by themselves or pair with a dose of protein, perhaps eggs or baked fish, for a complete meal.&nbsp;If you&#8217;re entertaining, the capsicums can be prepared and stuffed in advance. Store them in the fridge in an airtight container. Take them out an hour or so before baking so they can come to room temperature, or allow a bit of extra baking time if they&#8217;re still cold.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, omit the walnuts when making the pesto. For a vegan or dairy free version, the pesto is still very good without the parmesan (and I&#8217;ll sometimes make it without cheese if we&#8217;ve run out at home).</p>
<p><a name="stuffedcapsicums"></a></p>
<p><strong>Stuffed Capsicums</strong></p>
<p>Serves 4 as a side or light meal</p>
<ul>
<li>4 capsicums</li>
<li>â…“ cup brown rice</li>
<li>1 brown onion, diced</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely diced or chopped</li>
<li>6 leaves fresh sage, finely chopped</li>
<li>Â¼ cup currants</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>â…“ cup <a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2014/7/27/stuffed-capsicums-with-parsley-pesto#parsleypesto">parsley pesto (recipe below)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350F). Brush a baking dish large enough to hold all the capsicums lightly with olive oil.</p>
<p>Add the brown rice and Â¾ cup water to a saucepan and bring to the boil over a medium heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer until water is absorbed and rice tender, adding a little more water during cooking if needed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, behead the capsicums (i.e. slice the tops off so you have the capsicum with a &#8216;lid&#8217;). Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds; rinsing under running water can also help clear away loose seeds. Set aside for later use.</p>
<p>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pay over medium head and add the onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until onion softens. Add the garlic and sage and cook for another minute or two.</p>
<p>In a bowl stir together the onion mixture, rice, currants, and parsley pesto. Taste and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>Spoon stuffing into the capsicums and top with the lids. If you have left over filling it makes a tasty snack or part of lunch the next day. Arrange capsicums in the baking dish and bake until capsicums are cooked and stuffing is heated through, about 30 minutes. Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Parsley Pesto</strong></p>
<p>Makes about 3/4 cup</p>
<ul>
<li>large bunch flat-leaf parsley</li>
<li>1/4 cup walnuts, toasted</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, unpeeled</li>
<li>3-6 tablespoons olive oil (exact quantity will depend on how much parsley you have and on the blender you&#8217;re using).</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350F) and roast garlic for about 20 minutes, until tender.</p>
<p>Add parsley and 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil to a blender or small food processor (I&#8217;ve found my stick blender works best). Process until finely chopped and if parsley does not blend well add more oil. You may also need to stop the blender and scrape down the sides.</p>
<p>Peel the garlic and add it, the walnuts and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Process until you have a paste-like consistency.</p>
<p>Add the parmesan and process briefly to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</p>
<p>This will keep stored in the fridge for about a week. The colour may darken a little but it still tastes just as good.</p>

<p>This is one of my favourite post-workout snacks. It&#8217;s something of a cross between an egg flip and a banana smoothie and has good doses of both carbohydrates and protein to assist in recovery. I like to make it in two flavours: chocolate or vanilla.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll make this in the morning, keep it in the fridge at work and find it&#8217;s still fine for evening consumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, skip the LSA. For a dairy/lactose free option, replace the milk with soy milk or other non-dairy milk and likewise skip the yoghurt or use a non-dairy alternative.</p>
<p>Makes 1 large serving</p>
<ul>
<li>1 banana</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1/2 cup milk</li>
<li>2 tablespoons natural or greek yoghurt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon LSA</li>
<li>2 teaspoons cocoa powder or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence (adjust to taste)</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. How easy is that?!</p>

<p>Okay, so to say this blog&#8217;s been neglected lately is something of an understatement. Sometimes life just gets in the way and there are only so many things you can keep up with at once. Well, life has settled down somewhat lately, and I&#8217;ve been getting a number of requests to start posting again, so here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been getting several enquiries around the gym about some of the concoctions I&#8217;m seen snacking on so I&#8217;ll start by sharing some of those. I eat these fruit and nut balls as a high energy-density &#8216;fast&#8217; food to keep me going during long training sessions. If I&#8217;m doing two classes back-to-back I generally need to eat in between or my blood sugar can drop too low, but I don&#8217;t have much time and need something light enough that I can keep working on straight away.</p>
<p><span>The ingredients are quite flexible, as long as the ratios of fruit and nuts are kept similar. I use dried dates (because they&#8217;re both very tasty and very cheap) and prunes (because they&#8217;re sticky and help hold everything together) as the base. Go ahead and experiment with whatever fruits and nuts you prefer, but I&#8217;d recommend keeping the prunes in as they&#8217;re a good culinary &#8216;glue&#8217;. Also don&#8217;t go overboard with the seeds, I find they don&#8217;t crush up and hold together as well as the nuts.&nbsp;The ingredients below are suggestions, I&#8217;ll typically choose just a few based on what&#8217;s in my pantry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;I make up a big batch of balls and keep them in the fridge, taking about 3 balls as a &#8216;serving&#8217;. I can attest to them lasting at least 3-4 weeks in the fridge, mine have never lasted longer as they&#8217;re all gone by then!</p>
<p>For a seasonal touch: these would also be a nice treat as part of a Christmas spread.</p>
<p><span>Makes approximately 3 dozen balls</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup dried pitted dates</li>
<li>1 cup pitted prunes</li>
<li>1 cup mixed dried fruit (I like sultanas, cranberries, apricots, goji berries but feel free to try anything else)</li>
<li>2 cups mixed nuts and seeds (I like walnuts, cashews, blanched almonds, macadamias, hazelnuts, pepitas&#8230; the list goes on&#8230; but once again try whatever you like)</li>
<li>2/3 cup desiccated coconut</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients except coconut in a food processor and process until fruit and nuts are well chopped and mixture holds together well. If, like me, you&#8217;ve just dumped in all the fruit then all the nuts, or vice versa, you may need to stop the processor and stir the mixture up a bit to get it well combined then process a little longer. Or you could do the sensible thing and toss the fruit and nuts together first then process.</p>
<p><span>Put the coconut in a cereal bowl. Scoop out about a tablespoon of the fruit and nut mixture (enough to make a roughly 1 inch diameter ball). Roll into a ball between your hands then roll in the coconut to coat. Set aside and repeat until all the mixture has been used up. Try not to eat all at once and enjoy!</span></p>

<p>Winter has well and truly settled upon Canberra, and winter means cold mornings and warm breakfasts. The medical advice in Australia is that oats are not safe for those with coeliac disease. (I know this varies in other countries.) When I was first diagnosed my gastroenterologist explained that the reason for this is two-fold: First, oats and wheat are often grown in adjacent&nbsp;fields&nbsp;and processed on the same equipment so the risk of cross-contamination is very high. Second, oats contain a protein (called avenin) which is similar in structure to gluten and which around 1 in 5 coeliacs also react to. <a href="http://www.coeliac.org.au/coeliac-disease/faq.html" target="_blank">Coeliac Australia</a> explain that there is no way to test who will react to avenin in advance, and so they actually class avenin as a type of gluten and advise that coeliacs should not eat oats. I developed this recipe the first winter after I was diagnosed with coeliac disease and it has been our regular cold-weather breakfast ever since.</p>
<p>I make up containers of the mixed fruit and toasted nuts in advance and keep these in the pantry (store the fruit and nuts separately though to help keep the nuts nice and crunchy). The porridge can be left to simmer while you go and have a shower, but I&#8217;d only recommend this if you&#8217;ve made it a few times and know your stove so it neither boils over nor burns on the bottom in the mean time.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version skip the nuts. I started using soy milk as my partner is lactose-intolerant, but if lactose is okay you could substitute dairy milk.</p>
<p>Serves 2</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 cup buckwheat</li>
<li>1 cup soy milk, plus extra to serve</li>
<li>1 cardamon pod, bruised</li>
<li>2 cloves</li>
<li>1-inch piece cinnamon stick (a rolling pin works well to break up a tough stick of cinnamon)&nbsp;</li>
<li>1 apple or pear, cored and cut into 1-2cm cubes</li>
<li>1 banana, thinly sliced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons mixed dried fruit (I use sultanas, cranberries, and chopped dried apricots)&nbsp;</li>
<li>2 tablespoons mixed nuts, toasted (I use slivered almonds, chopped hazelnuts and chopped walnuts)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon honey, or to taste (I just dip the tip of each dessert spoon in the honey as serving and this is about right)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine buckwheat, 1 cup milk and the spices in a small saucepan over a medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring&nbsp;occasionally,&nbsp;until buckwheat is tender and milk absorbed, 20-30 minutes depending on how strong a simmer you have. If porridge dries out, add a little extra milk or the liquid from stewing the fruit (keep reading).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, stew the apple or pear: Place apple or pear in a small microwave-safe bowl, and pour over enough water to barely cover the fruit. Microwave for 3-5 minutes until tender then drain. (A ripe pear will cook in 3 minutes, an apple covered with cold water will need 5 minutes.)</p>
<p>Once the buckwheat is cooked, fish out the spices. Mix in banana and apple or pear and divide into two cereal bowls. Sprinkle each bowl with a spoonful each of dried fruit and nuts, stir through a little honey and add extra milk to taste.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t quite quick, due to the cooking time required, but it is dead easy to make, and oh so yummy. It&#8217;s a great option as a side when you&#8217;re preparing something else which is a bit involved, as this will take little effort from you and can cook in the mean time.</p>
<p>You could also try serving this sprinkled with pine nuts and/or goat&#8217;s cheese.</p>
<p>Serves 4 as a side</p>
<ul>
<li>1 large eggplant, cut in half lengthways</li>
<li>1 large red capsicum</li>
<li>1 head garlic (unpeeled)</li>
<li>1/2 cup fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 200ËšC (390 F).</p>
<p>Sprinkle cut sides of eggplant with salt and set aside, cut side down, to drain for at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, brush garlic lightly with olive oil and place it and the capsicum on a baking tray and cook until the skin on the capsicum has blistered and the garlic is tender, about 30 minutes. Turn the capsicum during cooking so the skin blisters on all sides. Set garlic and capsicum aside until cool enough to handle.</p>
<p>Rinse eggplant well and pat dry then brush the cut sides with olive oil. Place eggplant on a baking tray, cut sides face-down. Bake until eggplant is very tender (the skin will also be slightly crinkly), about 30-40 minutes.</p>
<p>Squeeze garlic out of its peel and into a bowl. Peel and seed capsicum, pat dry and finely dice, then add to the garlic. Peel eggplant skin away from the flesh (or if it&#8217;s not coming away easily, scoop flesh out with a metal spoon). Finely dice eggplant flesh and add to the bowl. Add the fresh basil, along with the balsamic, 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Adjust the vinegar and seasoning to taste.</p>
<p>Serve warm or at room temperature, spooned over the baby spinach.</p>
