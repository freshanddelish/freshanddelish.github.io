				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/img.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I tend to get a little concerned when I hear the &#8216;vegetarian&#8217;Â conversationÂ going on in the background while I&#8217;m cooking. It goes something like this:Â my partner being quizzed by our dinner guest along the lines of &#8220;so are you vegetarian too?&#8221;, &#8220;do you always eat vegetarian meals?&#8221;, &#8220;do you mind not eating meat at home?&#8221;, &#8220;what about protein?&#8221;,Â etc., etc. Fast forward an hour or two and said guest has not only complemented the meal butÂ scraped his plate clean and even volunteered to do the washing up (actions speak louder than words)&#8230;Â I think maybe I&#8217;ve changed someone&#8217;s mind on vegetarian cooking!</p>
<p>This recipe came about by combining a mango and halloumiÂ saladÂ suggestion fromÂ my good friend Tegan, with a mango and avocado saladÂ recipe fromÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-All-About-Vegetarian/dp/B0002Y0SII%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0002Y0SII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joy of Cooking: All About Vegetarian Cooking</a>Â by Irma Rombauer et al., along with some tweaks of my own. If you&#8217;ve tried my recipes before, hopefully you&#8217;ve learned that even (or especially) when you read anÂ ingredients list and the words &#8220;unlikely combination&#8221; come to mind, the result is going to be good. If you&#8217;re new to my blog then trust me, this is worth being a little adventurous!</p>
<p>I often include eggs with the salad to turn in into a complete meal, but I also like serving it without the eggs alongside panfried fish or to add a bit of &#8216;wow&#8217; factor to a spread.Â The number of eggs is also easily varied according to appetite: after something slightly lighter?Â make it 1 egg per person, feeding a hungry man after a big training session?Â pile on some extra eggs and maybe add a side with more carbs.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, skip the macadamias. For a vegan and dairy/lactose free salad, leave out the eggs and halloumiÂ and the resulting mango and avocado salad is still a great combination!</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>Â½ cup macadamia nuts</li>
<li>1 lemon, juiced (around 3 tablespoonsÂ lemon juice)</li>
<li>2 avocados</li>
<li>2 small-medium mangoes or 1 large</li>
<li>Â½ red onion</li>
<li>2 orÂ 3 tablespoons olive oil (use 3 tablespoons if you&#8217;re including eggs, otherwise just use 2)</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>Â¼ cup fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 cups baby spinach</li>
<li>8 eggs (optional)</li>
<li>200g halloumi</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 160ËšC (320 F). Coarsely chop the macadamias then spread on a baking tray. Bake in oven until macadamias are fragrant and lightly toasted. If your oven is preheated this will only take 3-5 minutes, although they may need longer if the oven&#8217;s still heating up.Â Keep a close eye on them, nuts will generally go from raw to burnt very easily if you get distracted. Once the macadamias are toasted set them aside until you&#8217;re ready to serve.</p>
<p>Place half the lemon juice in a medium-sized bowl.Â Slice the avocados lengthwise and remove the stones. Score flesh into approximately 1cm pieces then scoop it away from the skin and place in the bowl of lemon juice. Toss to coat the avocado with lemon juice &#8211;Â this will help prevent browning (which is quite harmless butÂ aesthetically not very pleasing).</p>
<p>Cut the mango(es) into approximately 1 cm pieces and add to the avocado. Peel and finely slice the red onion; add it to the mango and avocado then toss to combine.</p>
<p>Make the dressing: combine 2 tablespoon olive oil, the remaining lemon juice, finely chopped basil and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a jar and shake to combine.</p>
<p>Divide baby spinach between serving plates and spoon avocado and mango mixture over the top.</p>
<p>If serving with eggs: depending on your frying pan you may need to cook the eggs in a few batches.Â Heat the remaining tablespoon (or for batches, portion there-of)Â of olive oilÂ in a frying pan over medium heat. Keeping the medium heat, fry the eggs for a 2-3 minutes on each side until light golden and cooked through. Serve alongside the salad and season with a little salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>Finally, cook the halloumi. This is very quick so I do it last after I&#8217;ve cooked the eggs. Use the frying pan from the eggs that&#8217;s still hot, or heat your frying pan over a hot stove then turn the heat down to medium. Placing halloumi into an already hot pan will ensure it forms a delicious golden crust while melting on the insideÂ (whereas if itÂ cooks too slowly you may end up with a blob of molten cheese in your pan).Â There&#8217;s generally enough fat in the halloumi that it doesn&#8217;t need extra oil for cooking, especially if you&#8217;re using a non-stick frying pan. Cook over a medium heat for about 1 minute on each side until halloumi is golden brown then server over the salad.</p>
<p>Give the dressing you made another shake to ensure it&#8217;s well mixed then drizzle over the salad. Sprinkle with macadamia nuts and you&#8217;re good to go. Happy Dinner! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>If visiting family interstate for a couple of weeks taught me something it&#8217;s this: eating out of someone else&#8217;s kitchen is the mother of culinary invention. If you&#8217;re travelling, house-sitting, or for whatever reasonÂ don&#8217;t have access to your favourite go-to ingredients, rather than getting frustrated or feeling defeatedÂ why not view it as an opportunity to get creative?Â It&#8217;s moments like these when some of my favourite meals come into being;Â I may not even know quite what I&#8217;m making until I&#8217;m almost done, I just start putting things together and see where the food leads me. In this case it was to a refreshing, satisfying and nutritious lunch. Can&#8217;t have too many yummyÂ salad ideas methinks.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version,Â skip the almonds and seeds if needs be.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>Spices as follow:
<ul>
<li>1 teaspoon ras el hanout</li>
<li>Â½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>Â½ teaspoon ground coriander seeds</li>
<li>Â¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>â…” cup quinoa</li>
<li>2 teaspoons canola oil</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">2 teaspoons olive oil</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">salt and pepper (optional, to taste)</span></li>
<li><a href="#limeyoghurt"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Â¾ cupÂ </span>lime-infused yoghurt (recipe below)</a></li>
<li>250g cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>4 cups leafy greens (I used baby spinach and baby kale but other greens,Â based on your preferences and availability,Â should also work;Â for larger leaves remove any tough or fibrous stems andÂ cut or tear the leavesÂ into bite sized pieces)</li>
<li>Â½ cup almonds, coarsely chopped and lightly toasted</li>
<li>2 teaspoon chia seeds</li>
<li>2 teaspoons linseeds</li>
</ul>
<p>Hard boil the eggs:Â Place eggs in a saucepan and add enough cold water to completely cover them. Bring water to a boil over a high heat then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 12Â minutes. Remove eggs and set aside to cool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile combine the spices in the bottom of a saucepan and heat gently until fragrant. Set aside about 1<span style="font-size: 14px;">Â teaspoon of the spices but leave the rest in the saucepan.</span>Â Add the quinoa and canola oil to the saucepan with the spicesÂ and stir to combine. Cook over a medium heat, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat for 5 minutes (this will allow it to cool a bit so it doesn&#8217;t hiss tooÂ much and spit your quinoa out of theÂ when you add water). Add 1Â¼Â cups water to the saucepan, stir to mix with the quinoa,Â and return to the stove. Simmer over a low heat until water is absorbed and quinoa just cooked, adding a little extra water if needed. The quinoa will be cooked when the little rings start to separate from the central seed.</p>
<p>Once the eggs are cool enough to handle you can peel them (this can also be done under running cold water while the eggs are still hot): tap all sidesÂ against a hard surface, like your kitchen bench, to crack the shell then peel it away; getting under the thin &#8216;skin&#8217; between the egg and shell will make it easier to peel the shell away.</p>
<p>Cut the eggs into about 1 cm (<span style="font-size: 14px;">Â½ inch) chunks. In a small bowl, toss the eggs with the</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">Â teaspoon of spices you set aside earlier, the olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper, if using. Add eggs to the quinoa along with the tomatoes and toss to combine.</span></p>
<p>To serve, divide leafy greens between bowls then top with quinoa salad. Spoon the lime-infused yoghurt over the top andÂ sprinkle with the almonds, chia seeds and linseeds. Toss or mix it all together to eat!</p>
<h2 id="limeyoghurt">Lime-infused yoghurt</h2>
<p>Makes about Â¾ cup</p>
<ul>
<li>1 lime</li>
<li>â…“ cup fresh mint leaves</li>
<li>â…” cup natural yoghurt</li>
<li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the finest side of your grater or a microplane to zest the lime;Â then juice the lime. Finely chop the mint. Combine mint, lime zest and juice and yoghurt in a small bowl and mix to combine. Season with a pinch or two of pepper, to taste.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/spanakopitachickpeacrepeseditedresized.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This came about from my unwillingness to give up my favourite Spanakopita filling from my pre-coeliac-diagnosis days. Spanakopita is a Greek spinach and cheese pie. Here, I&#8217;ve taken the same spinach and cheese mix, rolled it up in chickpea crepes and topped with tomato sauce.</p>
<p>I used to make this with buckwheat crepes and ended up making chickpea crepes this time somewhat by accident. Well almost &#8211; I didn&#8217;t misread the label on the flour I was using, but I did forget to check the supplies in my pantry before doing the shopping. It turned out to be somewhat serendipitous as&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I think the chickpea flour actually results in a much better texture.</span></p>
<p>For a nut-free version, skip the pine nuts.</p>
<p>Serves 3-4 as a main or 6 as a starter</p>
<ul>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">1 onion, finely diced</span></li>
<li>1 large bunch spinach or silverbeet, stems&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">removed and finely chopped</span></li>
<li>2 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">300g ricotta</span></li>
<li>120g fetta</li>
<li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 tablespoons fresh mint, finely chopped</li>
<li>a few pinches ground nutmeg</li>
<li>a few pinches pepper</li>
<li>1 cup freshly grated parmesan, plus extra to serve</li>
<li>1/4 cup pine nuts, lightly toasted (be careful, they burn easily)</li>
<li><a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/4/30/spanakopita-filled-chickpea-crepes#chickpeacrepes">chickpea crepes (recipe below)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/4/30/spanakopita-filled-chickpea-crepes#tomatosauce">tomato sauce (recipe below)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350 F). Brush a baking dish (about 20cm x 30cm) lightly with olive oil.</p>
<p>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Add spinach and cook until just wilted. Transfer onion and spinach to a colander and allow to drain and cool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mix together eggs, cheeses, herbs and spices. Stir in the cooled spinach mixture.</p>
<p>Spread a chickpea crepe flat and spoon 3-4 tablespoons<span>&nbsp;</span><span>(about 1/6 of the total filling, depending on how many crepes you have)&nbsp;</span><span>of the mixture in a line down the middle. Sprinkle 1-2 teaspoons pine nuts over the top. Fold one side of the crepe over the filling, and roll towards the other side until you have a nice roll. Place roll in the baking dish with the &#8216;loose&#8217; side down to hold the roll closed. Repeat with remaining crepes.</span></p>
<p>Bake in the oven until filling has cooked through, about 40 minutes. If crepes are starting to brown (check after about 20 minutes), cover the dish with a sheet of alfoil, pricked in a couple of places to let steam escape.</p>
<p>Serve with tomato sauce spooned over the top and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.</p>
<p><a name="chickpeacrepes"></a></p>
<h3>Chickpea crepes</h3>
<p>For dairy/lactose-free crepes, use a non-dairy milk such as soy.</p>
<p>Makes about 6 20cm crepes</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup chickpea flour</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">pinch salt</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">1 egg, lightly beaten</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">3/4 cup milk</span></li>
<li>canola oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk together egg and milk. Add the liquids to the dry ingredients and whisk well until you have a smooth batter.</p>
<p>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat and add about 1 tablespoon oil to coat. Add about 1/2 cup (I use one ladle-full) of batter to the pan and swirl pan so batter spreads out to form a thin layer. For the spanakopita filled chickpea crepes, you want your crepes quite thin so you can roll them up; if the mixture isn&#8217;t spreading out enough you can thin the batter by adding a little more milk. Cook until top has just set and underside is golden. This will only take a minute or two once your pan is hot. Flip and cook for another minute or so until golden on both sides. Set aside, atop some paper towel to drain any excess oil. Repeat until all batter is cooked, adding a little oil between crepes if needed.</p>
<p><a name="tomatosauce"></a></p>
<h3>Tomato sauce</h3>
<p>Makes 2-3 cups</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">1 onion, finely diced</span></li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, finely diced or crushed</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano*</li>
<li>1/4 cup red wine (optional)</li>
<li>1 kg tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped**</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">1/2 cup fresh basil, finely diced*</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">salt</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">pepper</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"></span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">sugar (optional, if needed)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">*Use fresh or dried herbs, depending on what&#8217;s on hand. Just adjust the quantities (you&#8217;ll need less dried than fresh) and add dried herbs earlier on in the cooking than fresh.</span></p>
<p><span>**The Former Chef blog provides a good se</span><span>t of instructions on&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.formerchef.com/2009/08/20/how-to-peel-and-seed-fresh-tomatoes/">How to Peel and Seed Tomatoes</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>Heat olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and saute until tender, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and dried herbs and cook for another minute or two until fragrant. If using wine, add this now and cook until pan is almost dry (otherwise go straight to the next step).</p>
<p>Add the tomatoes and cook until sauce has thickened. I find this can take up to about half an hour. 5-10 minutes before sauce is ready, stir in the fresh herbs. Add a few pinches each of salt and pepper, to taste. Taste the sauce and if it is tart add a little sugar &#8211; only about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon to start, then adjust as needed. If you accidentally make your sauce too sweet you can balance it out with a little lemon juice.</p>
<p>You can serve this sauce immediately, or keep it in the fridge for a few days.</p>

<p>I am undecided whether this is a sweet or&nbsp;savoury&nbsp;dish. Being an optimist, I like to convince myself it&#8217;s savoury and have it for lunch paired with a leafy green salad. It&#8217;s also nice for afternoon tea or as part of a spread.</p>
<p>While I first encountered this via Stephanie Alexander, it&#8217;s actually based on a recipe published by Hannah Glasse in The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in the 18th Century! I don&#8217;t know about you, but being a lover of history I think that&#8217;s really cool. I tracked down <a href="http://www.celtnet.org.uk/recipes/glasse-lent-dinner-dishes-09.php#646" target="_blank">a copy of the original 1747 recipe on Celtnet</a>:</p>
</p>
<p>      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/artofcookery.png" alt=""/></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em>To make a carrot pudding.</em></p>
<p class="text-align-left">YOU muÅ¿t take a raw carrot, Å¿crape it very clean and grate it: Take half a pound of the grated carrot, and a pound of grated bread, beat up eight eggs, leave out half the whites, and mix the eggs with half a pint of cream : then Å¿tir in the bread and carrot, half a pound of freÅ¿h butter melted, half a pint of Å¿ack, and three Å¿poonfuls of orange-flower-water, a nutmeg grated. Sweeten to your palate. Mix all well together, and if it is not thin enough, Å¿tir in a little new milk or cream. Let it be of a moderate thickneÅ¿s, lay a puff-paÅ¿te all over the diÅ¿h, and pour in the ingredients. Bake it ; it will take an hour&#8217;s baking. Or you may boil it, but then you muÅ¿t melt butter and put in white wine and Å¿ugar.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s my 21st century gluten-free version:</p>
<p>Serves 6-8</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/4/15/carrot-tart#shortcrustpastry">shortcrust pastry (recipe below)</a>. Omit the sugar for this dish.</li>
<li>canola oil</li>
<li>rice flour</li>
<li>1 medium carrot, finely grated (about 3/4 cup)</li>
<li>1/2 cup almond meal</li>
<li>1 egg plus 1 egg yolk, lightly whisked</li>
<li>2/3 cup cream</li>
<li>60g butter, melted and allowed to cool</li>
<li>2 tablespoons caster sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350F). Lightly grease a tart tin (I use one with a removable base) with canola oil. Sprinkle with a little rice flour to coat the base and shake out excess flour. Line tin with pastry, blind bake for 10 minutes, remove from oven and set aside.</p>
<p>To make the filling, combine all remaining ingredients and mix well. Pour into the pre-baked tart shell and return to oven. Bake until filling has set and crust is lightly golden, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
<p><a name="shortcrustpastry"></a></p>
<h3>Shortcrust pastry</h3>
</p>
<p>Makes 1 23-25cm tart crust</p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/4 cups gluten-free flour*</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon caster sugar (optional, if using with a sweet filling)</li>
<li>90g unsalted butter, chilled and chopped into 1-2cm pieces</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<p>*I use the brown rice gluten-free flour mix suggested in&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gluten-Free-Baking-Classics-Annalise-Roberts/dp/1572840994%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1572840994">Gluten-Free Baking Classics</a></em>, by Annalise Roberts: 6 parts brown rice flour : 2 parts potato starch : 1 part tapioca starch.</p>
</p>
<p>I do all this in my food processor using the pastry attachment, which takes a matter of minutes, but it should work just as well mixing by hand.</p>
<p>Combine all dry ingredients and mix to combine. Add butter and process/stir until it&#8217;s well incorporated into the dry ingredients. You should have a consistency resembling that of of moist bread crumbs. Add the egg and lemon juice and process/stir until fully combined. Roll pastry into a ball and flatten slightly under your palm. Place between two sheets of baking paper and roll out until about 5mm thick and the right size for your dish/tin.</p></p>

<p><em>&#8220;What&#8217;s for dinner?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>&#8220;Umm, what&#8217;s in the fridge?&#8221;</p>
<p><em></em><em></em><em>&#8220;A selection of random veges, maybe a couple of eggs.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>Sound familiar? In our household this scenario often results in grilled vegetable stacks for dinner. The recipe below is for the version I made last night but you can really play around with the ingredients depending on your tastes and what&#8217;s on hand.</p>
<p>For a quicker option, skip or don&#8217;t salt the eggplant and cut down on the number of different vegetables used. For vegan or dairy/lactose-free versions, omit the eggs &amp;/or fetta as appropriate.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>1 eggplant, sliced into 5-10mm thick rounds</li>
<li>1 sweet potato, cut into 5-10mm thick slices</li>
<li>1 bulb garlic, cloves separated but unpeeled</li>
<li>1 red onion, cut into 12-16 wedges (12 for a medium onion, 16 for a large onion)</li>
<li>250g cherry tomatoes</li>
<li>1 red capsicum, cut in half and seeds removed</li>
<li>1 large or 2 small zucchinis, cut lengthways into 5mm thick slices (not rounds). If the zucchini is large, halve the slices.</li>
<li>100g mushrooms, sliced</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>Dried basil</li>
<li>4 eggs, hard-boiled or poached (instructions for both are below)</li>
<li>A splash of white wine vinegar for cooking the eggs</li>
<li>Balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>2 cups lettuce leaves,&nbsp;coarsely&nbsp;chopped</li>
<li>60g fetta cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is to cook all the vegetables, then it&#8217;s just about arranging it all on plates.</p>
<p><strong>Eggplant:</strong> Sprinkle eggplant with salt and set aside for 30 minutes. Rinse well and pat dry with paper towel. Heat a grill or frying pan over medium heat and thinly coat with olive oil. Add eggplant and grill/fry until golden brown on the underside, about 10 minutes. Flip and repeat until golden on both sides. Remove to drain on a paper towel and repeat with any remaining slices.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet potato, onion &amp; garlic:</strong> Meanwhile, preheat oven to 180ËšC (350 F). Brush a baking tray with olive oil and place sweet potato on the tray in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and a little dried basil. Arrange red onion and garlic cloves around sweet potato slices. Bake until sweek potato is starting to soften, about 15 minutes. Flip sweet potato slices and return to oven. Continue to bake until sweet potato is cooked through and starting to brown, and garlic and onion are soft.</p>
<p><strong>Capsicum &amp; tomatoes:</strong> Brush another baking tray lightly with olive oil. Place capsicum halves on tray with the skin-side up. Add tomatoes to the tray, and bake at 180ËšC until capsicum and tomato skins are blistered. I find this might normally take about 20 minutes, but is closer to 30-40 minutes if the tray is on the lower oven rack (under the sweet potato tray). Rinse the capsicum under cold water until cool enough to handle, then peel skin off and cut the flesh into slices.</p>
<p><strong>Zucchini:</strong>&nbsp;Lightly coat a grill or frying pan with olive oil. Grill or fry zucchini slices over a medium heat until golden on both sides, about 15 minutes total (flip half way). Drain on paper towel.</p>
<p><strong>Mushrooms:</strong>&nbsp;Heat a little olive oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and sautÃ© until golden, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>To hard-boil eggs:</strong> Place eggs in a saucepan and add enough cold water to cover completely. Adding a splash of white wine vinegar to the water will help the white set quickly in the event any of the shells crack while cooking, thus avoiding large globules of egg white leaking out. Bring to the boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and cook for 12 minutes. Allow eggs to cool enough to handle (cold running water helps here). Crack shell on a hard surface, peel and slice or chop.</p>
<p><strong>To poach eggs:</strong> Heat a saucepan of water, with a dash of white wine vinegar added, over a low heat until it is barely simmering. Again, the vinegar will help the egg white set quickly, so your egg doesn&#8217;t end up in threads through the water. You don&#8217;t want the water to be bubbling vigorously or the bubbles will tear the egg apart and you&#8217;ll end up with an unattractive egg broth. Crack one egg into the saucepan, just above the water (not too high or it will break up upon hitting the water). Cook for 3 minutes (I use the timer on my phone). Remove egg with a slotted spoon and allow to drain. Repeat for remaining eggs. You can reuse the water, but I generally fish out any bits of egg white left in the water between eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly:</strong>&nbsp;Spread lettuce leaves on dinner plates. Arrange grilled vegetables in layers to form a stack on each plate, starting with the large flat slices, like the eggplant and sweet potato at the bottom, and distributing rounder vegetables, like the tomatoes and garlic, around the edge of the stack. Top each stack with an egg season with salt and pepper to taste. Finally, crumble fetta over the top, drizzle with a little balsamic vinegar and serve.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not often one for luxurious brunches, partly because I usually wake up starving and want to eat breakfast straight away, and partly because of my weekend morning routine: Saturday mornings it&#8217;s off to the Farmers&#8217; Market, and I do a Sunday morning gym class. Over Easter, however, the Farmers&#8217; Market aren&#8217;t on and my gym&#8217;s not running its usual classes, which has made way for lazy mornings over these somewhat indulgent pancakes.</p>
<p>These pancakes are a good way to use up bananas which have ripened beyond eating fresh.&nbsp;They are thicker than your usual pancakes, more fritter- or muffin-like, which works especially well with the crunchiness of the toasted almonds. The almonds could be toasted, the dry ingredients mixed and toppings prepared the night before to make these really quick in the morning.</p>
<p>      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bananaalmondcoconutpancakes2editedresized.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Serves 3 generously, or perhaps 4 more respectably! (Makes about 9 8cm-diameter pancakes.)</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup almond meal</li>
<li>1/4 cup coconut flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup plain gluten-free flour*</li>
<li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup ripe bananas, mashed (2 large or 3 small bananas)</li>
<li>2 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
<li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
<li>1 tablespoon amaretti (alternatively you could try substituting 1 &#8211; 2 teaspoons almond essence)</li>
<li>1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted</li>
<li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
<li>Maple syrup or honey, seasonal fruit or other toppings to serve**</li>
</ul>
<p>*I use the brown rice gluten-free flour mix suggested in&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gluten-Free-Baking-Classics-Annalise-Roberts/dp/1572840994%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1572840994">Gluten-Free Baking Classics</a></em>, by Annalise Roberts: 6 parts brown rice flour : 2 parts potato starch : 1 part tapioca starch.</p>
<p>**The pancakes I served up were topped with maple syrup and apple sauce with fresh strawberries in one case, and cinnamon baked pear with strawberry sauce in the other. Recipes for the <a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/30/banana-almond-and-coconut-pancakes#applesauce">apple sauce</a>, <a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/30/banana-almond-and-coconut-pancakes#strawberrysauce">strawberry sauce</a> and <a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/30/banana-almond-and-coconut-pancakes#cinnamonbakedpear">cinnamon baked pear</a> are below.</p>
<p>Optional: preheat oven to a very low heat (60-80ËšC or 140-180F); you can use this to keep the first batches of pancakes warm while cooking the rest.</p>
<p>Combine all dry ingredients, except slivered almonds, in a large mixing bowl and mix well. In a separate, smaller bowl, combine wet ingredients except the butter.</p>
<p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until well combined. Stir in the toasted almonds. The batter will be much thicker and stickier than your usual pancake batter, more like a cake mix.</p>
<p>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat and melt a third of the butter in the pan. Add spoonfuls of the batter (roughly 1/3 cup in size) and use the back of a metal spoon to spread out until 1cm thick. Pancakes will be about 8-10cm in diameter. Cook until underside is golden, about 10 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on both sides. Place pancakes on an oven-proof plate or tray, lined with paper towels, and keep warm in the oven while you repeat to cook the remaining batter.</p>
<p>Serve&nbsp;immediately, topped with maple syrup or honey and fresh and/or cooked fruit.</p>
<p><a name="applesauce"></a></p>
<h3>Apple Sauce</h3>
<p>Makes roughly &nbsp;1 1/2 cups, which is about right for the above quantity of pancakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 granny-smith* apples, peeled, cored and chopped into about 1cm pieces</li>
<li>1/2-1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or 1/2 a cinnamon stick</li>
<li>1/4-1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, or 9 whole cloves</li>
<li>1 teaspoon raw sugar (white would also work)</li>
</ul>
<p>*if you happen to have a different variety of apples on hand, go ahead and use them, but omit the sugar. You could also use a similar recipe with pears.</p>
<p>Place apples in a small saucepan and add barely enough boiling water to cover. If using cinnamon stick and whole cloves add these now as well. Simmer until apple is soft and mushy, about 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>Drain apples, and fish out the spices (if added). Mash the apple. Add sugar and ground spices (if using) to taste and you&#8217;re done. This sauce will keep in the fridge for a few days.</p>
<p><a name="strawberrysauce"></a></p>
<h3>Strawberry Sauce</h3>
<p>Makes roughly &nbsp;1 1/2 cups, which is generous for the above quantity of pancakes as this sauce is very strong.</p>
<ul>
<li>500g fresh strawberries*, stems removed, halved</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon (about 1 &#8211; 1 1/2 tablespoons. You could also try substituting balsamic vinegar, in which case you might want to cut down the sugar)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon caster sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
</ul>
<p>*This recipe will work with most fresh or frozen berries, just adjust the sugar and lemon juice to taste.</p>
<p>Place strawberries in a small saucepan over a medium heat, and toss with sugar and lemon juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until strawberries are soft, about 10-15 minutes. Break the strawberries up a bit if they are large or haven&#8217;t started to disintegrate. Mix in vanilla essence.</p>
<p>Allow to cool slightly before serving. This sauce will keep in the fridge for a few days.</p>
<p><a name="cinnamonbakedpear"></a></p>
<h3>Cinnamon Baked Pear</h3>
<p>Serves 3-4 as a pancake topping, again matching the above quantity of pancakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 pears*, cored and cut into thin wedges/slices (about 5mm at their thickest point)</li>
<li>A few pinches cinnamon</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>
<p>*This would also work well with apples or perhaps peaches, but for peaches I&#8217;d double the thickness of the slices.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350 F). Brush a baking tray lightly with olive oil.</p>
<p>Spread pear slices in a single layer on the baking tray, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake until pear is tender, about 15-20 minutes. Very ripe fruit might cook more quickly, slightly under-ripe will take a bit longer.</p></p>

The combination of &nbsp;acidity from the vinegar, sweetness from the sugar and the depth of the cocoa results in a really interesting flavour, which some people like more than others. My partner loves it. I think it&#8217;s exciting that I get to use cocoa in a savoury dish!</p>
<p>The tomato sauce can be made in advance and stored in the fridge for a few days, or in the freezer for longer.</p>
</p>
<p>For vegan or nut-free versions, omit the eggs or almonds respectively.</p>
</p>
<p>Serves 5</p>
<ul>
<li>2 large or 3 medium eggplants, chopped into 2cm cubes</li>
<li>1 kg tomatoes</li>
<li>2 onions, one diced and one sliced</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or crushed</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>6 stalks celery, cut into 1cm pieces</li>
<li>1/4 cup capers, drained</li>
<li>1/3 cup white wine vinegar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons raw sugar plus a little extra (the extra is optional)</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
</ul>
<p>To serve:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 eggs, hardboiled, peeled and chopped (if feeding large appetites, add a couple more eggs)</li>
<li>1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted</li>
<li>1 cup brown rice, cooked</li>
</ul>
<p>Sprinkle the eggplant cubes with salt and set aside to drain for 30 minutes. The salt will draw out bitter liquids from the eggplant, improving the flavour. Alternatively, bring a large pot of water to the boil and cook the eggplant for 5-10 minutes. There&#8217;s a fair bit of debate around about whether this is necessary, and which method is best; I have found eggplant does benefit from some treatment, and either method works well for this recipe.</p>
<p>Make the tomato sauce: Peel, seed and chop tomatoes. The Former Chef blog provides a good set of instructions on <a href="http://www.formerchef.com/2009/08/20/how-to-peel-and-seed-fresh-tomatoes/">How to Peel and Seed Tomatoes</a>.</p>
<p>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat, add the <strong>diced</strong> onion and cook until soft, about 5-10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the tomatoes, bring to the simmer then turn the heat down to low (or you&#8217;ll end up with tomato juice splattered all over your stove top). Cook, stirring&nbsp;occasionally, until sauce has thickened. Taste and add a pinch of sugar if the sauce is tart. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set sauce aside to cool. When the sauce is cool enough, use a blender to puree until smooth.</p>
<p>Returning to the eggplant: rinse the salted eggplant well and pat dry. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a frying pan over high heat. Add half the eggplant and fry until lightly golden brown. Set aside to drain over some paper towel, add another tablespoon or two of oil to the pan and repeat with remaining eggplant.</p>
<p>Bring a saucepan of water to the boil over a medium heat. Add celery and blanch for two minutes then drain.</p>
<p>Heat another tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the <strong>sliced</strong> onion and cook until soft. Add the celery and cook for a minute longer. Next add the capers, vinegar, sugar, cocoa and tomato sauce and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Check the flavour and adjust vinegar, sugar and cocoa to taste. Add the eggplant and cook for a further 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Serve over brown rice, sprinkle with toasted almonds and surround with the hardboiled eggs.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This is definitely one of our go-to recipes.&#160;Omelettes&#160;are quick, easy, tasty, healthy, and the ingredients are flexible depending on what's on hand, which makes them a great weeknight dinner option.</p>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Sweetpotatoomletteresized.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This is definitely one of our go-to recipes.&nbsp;Omelettes&nbsp;are quick, easy, tasty, healthy, and the ingredients are flexible depending on what&#8217;s on hand, which makes them a great weeknight dinner option.</p>
<p>You can really play around with whatever takes your fancy for the omelette fillings. I prefer to add most of the fillings after the omelette is cooked, keeping the base quite thin, but don&#8217;t hesitate to play around with this too. For a flavourful varient, try adding some finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes and fresh oregano or thyme to the egg mix.</p>
<p>Per&nbsp;omelette:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1/4 cup freshly grated cheese, I generally use parmesan, but cheddar or any other hard cheese also works</li>
<li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
<li>2 shallots/scallions, finely sliced</li>
<li>salt &amp; pepper</li>
<li>fresh herbs, finely chopped (optional, depending on what you have. Chives, parsley, basil, etc. work well)</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>extra grated cheddar for sprinkling (optional)</li>
<li>Fillings &#8211; see below</li>
</ul>
<p>Whisk the eggs in a small bowl. Add the 1/4 cup cheese, milk, shallots, salt, pepper and herbs, if using, and mix to combine.</p>
<p>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Coat pan with a little olive oil. Pour omelette mixture into pan and swirl to distribute evenly. If you&#8217;re a cheese-aholic, go ahead and sprinkle some extra grated cheddar over the top.</p>
<p>Cook until golden brown on the bottom &#8211; use a spatula to take a peek at the underside &#8211; and set on top, about 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>Spoon fillings in a semi-circle over half the omelette. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Fold the other half of the omelette over the top, and slide onto a plate to serve.</p>
<p>Some of our favourite omelette fillings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweet potato, boiled, grilled or baked, with baby spinach and fetta cheese.</li>
<li>Baked or boiled potato with rosemary (this is great comfort food).</li>
<li>SautÃ©ed garlic, mushrooms and asparagus.</li>
<li>Grilled&nbsp;Mediterranean vegetables, e.g. zucchini, capsicum, tomatoes and red onion, with fetta cheese.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

Knowing the soufflÃ©&#8217;s reputation for being highly temperamental and near-on impossible to pull off, I was somewhat apprehensive the first time I attempted this recipe. However, years later I can happily report that I have made this recipe dozens of times and never once had it fail. The recipe has developed from the spinach soufflÃ© recipe in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-All-About-Vegetarian/dp/B0002Y0SII%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0002Y0SII" target="_blank">Joy of Cooking: All About Vegetarian Cooking</a> by Irma Rombauer et al.</p>
<p>The one occasion that springs to mind of when things did not quite go according to plan was when I was visiting my sister and cooked these soufflÃ©s for dinner. She didn&#8217;t have any ramekins so I instead made them in oven-safe coffee mugs, and with the different shape I somewhat misjudged their capacity&#8230; half an hour later lil&#8217; sis had something of a mess in the bottom of her oven, but honestly the soufflÃ© left in the coffee mugs (which, to be fair, was most of it) tasted as good as always. As a pointer though, my ramekins have a capacity of 350ml, measuring about 9cm in diameter and 6cm high.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d suggest preparing any sides you&#8217;re planning on having with your soufflÃ©, which take more than 15 minutes to make, in advance. While I think the difficulty of making soufflÃ©s is often exaggerated, the phrase &#8220;you can wait for soufflÃ©, but soufflÃ© wont wait for you&#8221; is quite true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When making this for just the two of us, I&#8217;ll usually prepare the&nbsp;bÃ©chamel for four (as below) and cook an entire bunch of silverbeet, &nbsp;then store half of each in the fridge to make souffÃ©s again the following night.</p>
<p>For those of you in Canberra: my secret ingredient is the Small Cow Farm fetta, available from the Farmers&#8217; Market at EPIC; hands down the best fetta I&#8217;ve tasted.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
<li>1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>4 eggs, separated</li>
<li>BÃ©chamel&nbsp;sauce (see below)</li>
<li>100 g fetta cheese</li>
<li>1 large bunch silverbeet</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>white pepper</li>
<li>ground nutmeg</li>
</ul>
<p>BÃ©chamel&nbsp;sauce:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>1 bay leaf</li>
<li>3 cloves</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, peeled</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>2 tablespoons flour*</li>
</ul>
<p>*I use the brown rice gluten-free flour mix suggested in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gluten-Free-Baking-Classics-Annalise-Roberts/dp/1572840994%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1572840994" target="_blank">Gluten-Free Baking Classics</a></em>, by Annalise Roberts: 6 parts brown rice flour : 2 parts potato starch : 1 part tapioca starch.</p>
</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 200ËšC (390 F). Prepare the ramekins: Cut the 1 teaspoon of butter into four pieces and place one in each ramekin. Microwave for 30 seconds, or until the butter is melted. Brush the butter over the base and up the sides of the ramekins so that they are well coated. Place about 1 tablespoon grated parmesan in each ramekin, and roll around so the base and sides are also coated with the parmesan. Set aside.</p>
</p>
<p>Make the bÃ©chamel:</p>
<p>Place the garlic under the flat of a knife blade and press down to crush slightly. You want to keep it in one or two pieces (not put through a garlic crusher to mince), but breaking it up a bit will help the flavour leach into the milk more readily. Place the milk in a saucepan along with the garlic, cloves and bay leaf. Bring to a gentle simmer over a low heat, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring&nbsp;occasionally. Keep an eye on the milk as it&#8217;s heating; if it starts to boil too vigorously you will very quickly have more milk on the stovetop than in the saucepan.</p>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the butter and flour in a small saucepan and cook over a medium heat, stirring. Once the butter has melted, continue to cook for a few minutes or until the roux is fragrant, then remove from the heat.</p>
<p>Remove the garlic, cloves and bay leaf from the milk. Gradually stir the milk into the roux. Adding a few tablespoons of milk at a time and combining before adding more will help prevent lumps from forming. If the sauce does become lumpy, don&#8217;t bother starting again. Lumpy&nbsp;bÃ©chamel&nbsp;wont be very nice poured over vegetables, but it&#8217;s unlikely to affect the texture of the soufflÃ©.</p>
<p>When all the milk has been combined, return the sauce to the stove. Cook over a low heat, stirring continuously (lumps will form very quickly if you stop), until thickened. You want the sauce to be thick enough that it can&#8217;t be easily poured, but not so dry that it looses its &#8216;smoothness&#8217;. If the sauce is really runny and not thickening, add a little extra flour. If the sauce thickens/drys out too much (someone called me with an SOS describing their sauce as &#8220;like mashed potato&#8221;) stir in some more milk.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got the consistency of the sauce about right, stir in a pinch each of salt, white pepper and nutmeg. Adjust seasoning to taste.</p>
<p>The bÃ©chamel sauce can be made&nbsp;up to&nbsp;a day ahead and stored in the fridge. I find it generally doesn&#8217;t last more than two days before spoiling.</p>
<p>To complete the soufflÃ©s:</p>
<p>Whisk the egg yolks and stir in the bÃ©chamel, remaining parmesan, a pinch of nutmeg and a couple of pinches of salt and pepper. Crumble in the fetta.</p>
<p>Prepare the silverbeet: Remove the stems and rinse. Cook in a large pot of boiling water for a few minutes until wilted. Drain, run under cold water (to cool enough to handle), and drain again. Squeeze tightly to remove the excess liquid. Finely dice, and stir into the soufflÃ© mixture.</p>
<p>To the egg whites, add a pinch of salt. &#8216;Pure&#8217; egg whites will form a better foam when beaten, but adding some salt helps stabilise the foam, so the idea is to add just a little salt as a stabiliser, without compromising too much on the volume of the foam. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Spoon about a third of the egg whites into the bÃ©chamel mixture and stir until just combined. This lightens the mixture before combining the remaining egg whites. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites, again until just combined.</p>
<p>Pour soufflÃ© mix into prepared ramekins and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until golden brown. (Check the soufflÃ©s after 20 minutes, exact cooking time will depend on your oven). Serve immediately.</p></p>
