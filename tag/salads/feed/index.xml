<p>I tend to get a little concerned when I hear the &#8216;vegetarian&#8217;Â conversationÂ going on in the background while I&#8217;m cooking. It goes something like this:Â my partner being quizzed by our dinner guest along the lines of &#8220;so are you vegetarian too?&#8221;, &#8220;do you always eat vegetarian meals?&#8221;, &#8220;do you mind not eating meat at home?&#8221;, &#8220;what about protein?&#8221;,Â etc., etc. Fast forward an hour or two and said guest has not only complemented the meal butÂ scraped his plate clean and even volunteered to do the washing up (actions speak louder than words)&#8230;Â I think maybe I&#8217;ve changed someone&#8217;s mind on vegetarian cooking!</p>
<p>This recipe came about by combining a mango and halloumiÂ saladÂ suggestion fromÂ my good friend Tegan, with a mango and avocado saladÂ recipe fromÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-All-About-Vegetarian/dp/B0002Y0SII%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0002Y0SII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joy of Cooking: All About Vegetarian Cooking</a>Â by Irma Rombauer et al., along with some tweaks of my own. If you&#8217;ve tried my recipes before, hopefully you&#8217;ve learned that even (or especially) when you read anÂ ingredients list and the words &#8220;unlikely combination&#8221; come to mind, the result is going to be good. If you&#8217;re new to my blog then trust me, this is worth being a little adventurous!</p>
<p>I often include eggs with the salad to turn in into a complete meal, but I also like serving it without the eggs alongside panfried fish or to add a bit of &#8216;wow&#8217; factor to a spread.Â The number of eggs is also easily varied according to appetite: after something slightly lighter?Â make it 1 egg per person, feeding a hungry man after a big training session?Â pile on some extra eggs and maybe add a side with more carbs.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, skip the macadamias. For a vegan and dairy/lactose free salad, leave out the eggs and halloumiÂ and the resulting mango and avocado salad is still a great combination!</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>Â½ cup macadamia nuts</li>
<li>1 lemon, juiced (around 3 tablespoonsÂ lemon juice)</li>
<li>2 avocados</li>
<li>2 small-medium mangoes or 1 large</li>
<li>Â½ red onion</li>
<li>2 orÂ 3 tablespoons olive oil (use 3 tablespoons if you&#8217;re including eggs, otherwise just use 2)</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>Â¼ cup fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 cups baby spinach</li>
<li>8 eggs (optional)</li>
<li>200g halloumi</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 160ËšC (320 F). Coarsely chop the macadamias then spread on a baking tray. Bake in oven until macadamias are fragrant and lightly toasted. If your oven is preheated this will only take 3-5 minutes, although they may need longer if the oven&#8217;s still heating up.Â Keep a close eye on them, nuts will generally go from raw to burnt very easily if you get distracted. Once the macadamias are toasted set them aside until you&#8217;re ready to serve.</p>
<p>Place half the lemon juice in a medium-sized bowl.Â Slice the avocados lengthwise and remove the stones. Score flesh into approximately 1cm pieces then scoop it away from the skin and place in the bowl of lemon juice. Toss to coat the avocado with lemon juice &#8211;Â this will help prevent browning (which is quite harmless butÂ aesthetically not very pleasing).</p>
<p>Cut the mango(es) into approximately 1 cm pieces and add to the avocado. Peel and finely slice the red onion; add it to the mango and avocado then toss to combine.</p>
<p>Make the dressing: combine 2 tablespoon olive oil, the remaining lemon juice, finely chopped basil and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a jar and shake to combine.</p>
<p>Divide baby spinach between serving plates and spoon avocado and mango mixture over the top.</p>
<p>If serving with eggs: depending on your frying pan you may need to cook the eggs in a few batches.Â Heat the remaining tablespoon (or for batches, portion there-of)Â of olive oilÂ in a frying pan over medium heat. Keeping the medium heat, fry the eggs for a 2-3 minutes on each side until light golden and cooked through. Serve alongside the salad and season with a little salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>Finally, cook the halloumi. This is very quick so I do it last after I&#8217;ve cooked the eggs. Use the frying pan from the eggs that&#8217;s still hot, or heat your frying pan over a hot stove then turn the heat down to medium. Placing halloumi into an already hot pan will ensure it forms a delicious golden crust while melting on the insideÂ (whereas if itÂ cooks too slowly you may end up with a blob of molten cheese in your pan).Â There&#8217;s generally enough fat in the halloumi that it doesn&#8217;t need extra oil for cooking, especially if you&#8217;re using a non-stick frying pan. Cook over a medium heat for about 1 minute on each side until halloumi is golden brown then server over the salad.</p>
<p>Give the dressing you made another shake to ensure it&#8217;s well mixed then drizzle over the salad. Sprinkle with macadamia nuts and you&#8217;re good to go. Happy Dinner! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>If visiting family interstate for a couple of weeks taught me something it&#8217;s this: eating out of someone else&#8217;s kitchen is the mother of culinary invention. If you&#8217;re travelling, house-sitting, or for whatever reasonÂ don&#8217;t have access to your favourite go-to ingredients, rather than getting frustrated or feeling defeatedÂ why not view it as an opportunity to get creative?Â It&#8217;s moments like these when some of my favourite meals come into being;Â I may not even know quite what I&#8217;m making until I&#8217;m almost done, I just start putting things together and see where the food leads me. In this case it was to a refreshing, satisfying and nutritious lunch. Can&#8217;t have too many yummyÂ salad ideas methinks.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version,Â skip the almonds and seeds if needs be.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>Spices as follow:
<ul>
<li>1 teaspoon ras el hanout</li>
<li>Â½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>Â½ teaspoon ground coriander seeds</li>
<li>Â¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>â…” cup quinoa</li>
<li>2 teaspoons canola oil</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">2 teaspoons olive oil</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">salt and pepper (optional, to taste)</span></li>
<li><a href="#limeyoghurt"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Â¾ cupÂ </span>lime-infused yoghurt (recipe below)</a></li>
<li>250g cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>4 cups leafy greens (I used baby spinach and baby kale but other greens,Â based on your preferences and availability,Â should also work;Â for larger leaves remove any tough or fibrous stems andÂ cut or tear the leavesÂ into bite sized pieces)</li>
<li>Â½ cup almonds, coarsely chopped and lightly toasted</li>
<li>2 teaspoon chia seeds</li>
<li>2 teaspoons linseeds</li>
</ul>
<p>Hard boil the eggs:Â Place eggs in a saucepan and add enough cold water to completely cover them. Bring water to a boil over a high heat then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 12Â minutes. Remove eggs and set aside to cool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile combine the spices in the bottom of a saucepan and heat gently until fragrant. Set aside about 1<span style="font-size: 14px;">Â teaspoon of the spices but leave the rest in the saucepan.</span>Â Add the quinoa and canola oil to the saucepan with the spicesÂ and stir to combine. Cook over a medium heat, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat for 5 minutes (this will allow it to cool a bit so it doesn&#8217;t hiss tooÂ much and spit your quinoa out of theÂ when you add water). Add 1Â¼Â cups water to the saucepan, stir to mix with the quinoa,Â and return to the stove. Simmer over a low heat until water is absorbed and quinoa just cooked, adding a little extra water if needed. The quinoa will be cooked when the little rings start to separate from the central seed.</p>
<p>Once the eggs are cool enough to handle you can peel them (this can also be done under running cold water while the eggs are still hot): tap all sidesÂ against a hard surface, like your kitchen bench, to crack the shell then peel it away; getting under the thin &#8216;skin&#8217; between the egg and shell will make it easier to peel the shell away.</p>
<p>Cut the eggs into about 1 cm (<span style="font-size: 14px;">Â½ inch) chunks. In a small bowl, toss the eggs with the</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">Â teaspoon of spices you set aside earlier, the olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper, if using. Add eggs to the quinoa along with the tomatoes and toss to combine.</span></p>
<p>To serve, divide leafy greens between bowls then top with quinoa salad. Spoon the lime-infused yoghurt over the top andÂ sprinkle with the almonds, chia seeds and linseeds. Toss or mix it all together to eat!</p>
<h2 id="limeyoghurt">Lime-infused yoghurt</h2>
<p>Makes about Â¾ cup</p>
<ul>
<li>1 lime</li>
<li>â…“ cup fresh mint leaves</li>
<li>â…” cup natural yoghurt</li>
<li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the finest side of your grater or a microplane to zest the lime;Â then juice the lime. Finely chop the mint. Combine mint, lime zest and juice and yoghurt in a small bowl and mix to combine. Season with a pinch or two of pepper, to taste.</p>

<p>Despite being fairly confident that&nbsp;there would be plenty of food&nbsp;I agreed to add an extra dish,&nbsp;opting&nbsp;for a leafy salad to complement the already substantial meal.&nbsp;As it turns out, we were still polishing off the left overs three days later!&nbsp;(Admittedly&nbsp;left-overs <em>are</em> almost compulsory following Christmas lunch.) In this case it definitely&nbsp;worked out for the best because this creation is really very good&nbsp;(am I allowed to say that about my own recipe?)</p>
<p>Back home and through the process of testing the recipe this salad&nbsp;has rapidly become a favourite. Only thing is, there are two versions and I can&#8217;t decide which I like best, so I&#8217;ve included both options and you can choose for yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question before you is this: pomegranate or cranberries? The pomegranate seeds are refreshing and add a nice crunch. The cranberries are sweeter and slightly chewy. I like both versions. I&#8217;d suggest the pomegranate&nbsp;as a nice refreshing choice&nbsp;on a&nbsp;warm day, and the cranberries when you&#8217;re looking to bring a little more sweetness to the meal. Dried cranberries are also typically easier to come by than fresh pomegranates.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px">I haven&#8217;t included rocket in my leafy greens.&nbsp;Personally I don&#8217;t like rocket&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;I find it too hot &#8211;&nbsp;while the watercress here is just a little peppery.&nbsp;If you are a fan of rocket&nbsp;I suspect if would work well in this salad, and I always encourage experimentation when cooking.</span></p>
<p>For a nut free version, skip the almonds. It won&#8217;t be as crunchy but the combination of flavours should still survive. For a vegan or dairy/lactose-free alternative, omit the parmesan.</p>
<p>Serves 4 as a side</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups baby kale</li>
<li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
<li>1 cup watercress leaves, removed from stems</li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px">Â½</span> cup almonds</li>
<li>1 pomegranate or Â½ cup dried cranberries</li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px">Â½</span> cup shaved parmesan</li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px">Â½</span> red onion, finely sliced or diced</li>
<li><a href="#"><span style="font-size:14px">â…“ cup m</span>ustard Vinaigrette (recipe below)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If using a&nbsp;pomegranate, start by seeding the fruit (otherwise, skip straight to the next paragraph). Tori&nbsp;Avey provides some great instructions explaining&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/2011/09/how-to-seed-a-pomegranate/#recipe">How to Seed a Pomegranate</a>. (Tori&#8217;s post also includes instructions for juicing a pomegranate &#8211; don&#8217;t go that far here, for this salad you want to keep the seeds whole.)</p>
<p>Place kale, spinach and&nbsp;watercress&nbsp;in a large salad bowl and toss to mix. Pour mustard vinaigrette over the top&nbsp;and toss again so the greens are well coated with&nbsp;the dressing. Add the almonds, pomegranate or cranberries, parmesan and onion. Toss to combine all ingredients and serve straight away.</p>
<p><a name="mustardvinaigrette"></a></p>
<p><strong>Mustard Vinaigrette</strong></p>
<p>Makes a little over&nbsp;â…“ cup</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:14px">Â½</span> lemon, juiced (around 1Â½ tablespoons lemon juice)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>
<li>2 teaspoons white wine vinegar</li>
<li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>pinch each of&nbsp;salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a jar,&nbsp;(ensure the lid is properly secured,)&nbsp;and shake well to combine.</p>

<p>Summer has arrived and doesn&#8217;t the warmer weather just make it so much easier to eat well?! <span style="font-size:14px">Here&#8217;s another idea for a refreshing and tasty salad to enjoy and feel good about.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:14px">To my readers in the Northern hemisphere, the key fruit and vegetables: oranges, carrots and leafy greens, are in season during winter too, and it&#8217;s never the wrong time of year to eat well!</span></p>
<p>This salad is super fresh&nbsp;and simply dressed,&nbsp;it&#8217;s all about letting quality ingredients shine through. So, a few pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the slightly saggy week-old carrots sitting in the bottom of your fridge&#8217;s crisper for stock or juice and buy (or dig!) a fresh bunch.</li>
<li>Now&#8217;s the time to splash out on good quality tofu;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px">you&#8217;re not going to be cooking it or hiding it under any sauces here so</span>&nbsp;it&#8217;s worth an extra couple of dollars for the organic option.</li>
<li>When I used to think of olive oil&nbsp;I thought of Italy, but it turns out Australia produces its own great olive oils here at home. In fact, my favourite: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homeleighgroveolives.com.au/index.html">Homeleigh Grove&#8217;s</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homeleighgroveolives.com.au/OliveProducts.htm">&#8216;Lowanna&#8217;s Paddock&#8217;</a>, a Robust extra virgin olive oil,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.irvea.org/in-evidenza/nz-sa-2014-awards-ceremony/">was recently awarded first place in a Southern hemisphere international competition</a>! So next time you&#8217;re shopping for olive oil, why not try buying local: if you&#8217;re lucky enough to have a farmers&#8217; market near by, that&#8217;s a good bet, otherwise IGA supermarkets are pretty good at stocking local products too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did I mention fresh was the key here?&nbsp;I&#8217;m a bit proud of our little veggie garden lately which has become quite productive; you can&#8217;t get much fresher than picked 15 minutes ago!&nbsp;In case you were wondering, here&#8217;s the before photo: spring harvest of homegrown parsley, carrots and kale&#8230;</p>
<p>      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/img.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This salad is good prepared and served straight away, but if you&#8217;re the oranised type it doesn&#8217;t hurt to let the tofu &#8216;marinate&#8217; with the oranges and herbs in the fridge for a few hours &#8211; just see the guidelines in the recipe below.</p>
<p>If seeds may be an allergen for you or someone you&#8217;re feeding, just leave them off the salad, the fresh carrots will still add a nice crunch. The basil is a nice addition and works well with the other flavours, but I&#8217;ve also made it with just the parsley if I haven&#8217;t had basil on hand.</p>
<p>Serves 5</p>
<ul>
<li>400-500g firm tofu</li>
<li>3 navel oranges (other varieties will work too, just be sure to remove the pips)</li>
<li>Small bunch parsley (approximately 1 cup, loosely packed)</li>
<li>Optional: a few sprigs fresh basil (approximately Â½ cup, loosely packed)</li>
<li>1 bunch baby (also known as &#8216;Dutch&#8217;) carrots (regular &#8216;adult&#8217; carrots will work too, if that&#8217;s what&#8217;s available)</li>
<li>1 bunch kale, silverbeet, spinach or other dark leafy green</li>
<li>2 teaspoons poppy seeds</li>
<li>â…“ heaped cup pepitas (pumpkin seeds)</li>
<li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>Cut the tofu into 1 cm &nbsp;(Â½ inch) cubes and place in a large&nbsp;bowl. Peel the oranges, cut into bite-sized pieces and add to the tofu. Remove the parsley and basil (if using) leaves from their stems. (You can discard the stems).&nbsp;Finely chop the&nbsp;leaves and add to the tofu and oranges. Add just a few pinches each of salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.&nbsp;Mix well to combine ingredients.&nbsp;If you&#8217;re preparing this in advance stop here, cover and store in the fridge until you&#8217;re just about ready to serve.</p>
<p>Cut the carrots into small pieces (less than 1 cm, or about&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px">Â¼ inch in size). Toss through the salad.</span></p>
<p>Remove any tough, fibrous stems from your leafy greens. Coarsely chop or tear the leaves and use these to line serving bowls. Spoon the tofu mix over the greens and&nbsp;drizzle with olive oil (a few teaspoons per serve). Finally, sprinkle with poppy seeds (about&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px">Â½ teaspoon per serve) and pepitas (about 1 tablespoon per serve). Important: don&#8217;t add the seeds until you&#8217;re ready to serve the salad, it will keep them nice and crunchy. Enjoy!</span></p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;and welcome to the latest episode of &#8216;What&#8217;s Left in the Fridge at the End of the Week?&#8217; And the answer is: carrots, chestnuts, a bunch of silverbeet and some lemons. The lemons are still in the fridge, everything else went into this surprisingly successful creation that I&#8217;ll definitely be making again.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped or crushed</li>
<li>6 sprigs thyme</li>
<li>6 sage leaves, finely chopped</li>
<li>1/4 tsp cumin seeds</li>
<li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
<li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>2 bunches carrots</li>
<li>500g chestnuts</li>
<li><span>Â½</span>&nbsp;cup parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 red onion, finely diced</li>
<li>Large bunch silverbeet</li>
<li>1 cup cashews, roasted</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350F).</p>
<p>Place cumin seeds in a skillet and cook over a low heat until they become fragrant. Don&#8217;t leave them unattended for long because they&#8217;ll quickly go from lightly toasted to burnt; I&#8217;d suggest removing the seeds from the heat when their scent becomes stronger, rather than waiting for them to appear brown.</p>
<p>Remove leaves from thyme and discard the stems. In a small bowl combine the thyme and sage leaves, garlic, cumin seeds, honey, sherry, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Cut the carrots into sticks approximately 1 cm (Â½ &nbsp;inch) thick and toss through the spiced oil you just mixed up. Spread in a baking dish&nbsp;and bake until just tender, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile roast and peel the chestnuts: Use a Stanley knife to cut a slice through the top (the pointy&nbsp;end) of each chestnut. Place on a tray and bake for 15-20 minutes until the skin starts to look a little crinkly or to split. Remove only a cup or so of&nbsp;chestnuts from the oven at a time as they&#8217;re easiest to peel while still quite hot. Peel the outer shell and inner skin from each chestnut.&nbsp;I wear a rubber glove on one hand but leave the other free as a balance between not getting burnt and maintaining a degree of dexterity.</p>
<p>Add chestnuts to the dish roasted carrots along with parsley and red onion. Toss to combine then return to the oven for about 5 minutes while you prepare the silverbeet.</p>
<p>Remove the stems from the silverbeet and coarsely chop the leaves. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the silverbeet and toss to coat with&nbsp;the oil. Cook, stirring frequently,&nbsp;until just wilted (if the oil is already hot this will only take a minute or two).&nbsp;Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re ready to serve: Divide the silverbeet between plates or bowls. Top with&nbsp;carrots and chestnuts and sprinkle with roasted cashews.</p>

<p>I like to serve this salad as an accompaniment to fish, especially a stronger-flavoured fish like salmon. There&#8217;s something about the combination of earthy mushrooms and slightly salty potato that just seems like a good match for fish to me. Add the fennel and you&#8217;ve got a nice seasonal salad for Autumn.</p>
<p>GruyÃ¨re cheese works very well in this dish, but it&#8217;s quite expensive and I don&#8217;t tend to keep it on hand, so I&#8217;ll often just use cheddar which is also tasty.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, skip the pine nuts and replace the peanut oil with canola oil. For a dairy/lactose-free or vegan salad, omit the cheese.</p>
<p>Serves 3-4 as a side</p>
<ul>
<li>400g mushrooms, quartered, halved or left whole, depending on size</li>
<li>1 bulb baby fennel, trimmed, quartered, cored and finely sliced</li>
<li>600g potatoes (I really like dutch cream, but any white potato will do)</li>
<li>100g cheddar or gruyÃ¨re cheese, cut into 1cm cubes</li>
<li>2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>peanut oil</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine the balsamic and olive oil in a medium bowl along with a pinch each of salt and pepper. Add the mushrooms and mix until the mushrooms are well coated with the&nbsp;vinaigrette. Add the fennel, toss to combine and set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until just tender &#8211; firm enough that they still retain their shape. You&#8217;ll be cooking them further under the grill so try not to over cook them here. Drain, pat dry and cut into 2cm cubes. Toss with just enough peanut oil to lightly coat the potatoes. Heat grill or broiler (or you can use a hot oven). Spread potatoes on a tray in a single layer and sprinkle lightly with salt. Place under grill or broiler and cook until golden and crispy, 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>To serve, combine mushroom and fennel with potatoes and cheese, and sprinkle pine nuts over the top.</p>

<p>I made mayonnaise on the weekend to serve with a baked snapper, and had some left over. Pondering what to do with it, I remembered this unusual broccoli salad, which is an interesting mix of a creamy dressing, sweet cranberries and of course nice healthy broccoli. If you have someone who doesn&#8217;t like their greens, perhaps give this one a try.</p>
<p>Despite the broccoli, this is actually quite a sweet salad, so keep this in mind when thinking about what to pair it with (perhaps a quiche or grilled fish).</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, just skip the almonds.</p>
<p>Serves 4 as a side</p>
<ul>
<li>2 heads broccoli, stems and florets, chopped into bite-size pieces</li>
<li>1/2 cup mayonnaise*</li>
<li>1 scant tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
<li>1/4 red onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1/2 cup dried cranberries</li>
<li>1/2 cup flaked or slivered almonds, toasted</li>
</ul>
<p>*On this occasion I used homemade mayonnaise, which was delicious, but I have made this with store-bought before and that works too. This was my first time making mayonnaise so I haven&#8217;t developed my own version yet, but if you&#8217;re interested, the recipe I followed can be found <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jul/01/how-to-make-perfect-mayonnaise" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Steam the broccoli until just tender, you want it to retain some crispness so try and avoid over-cooking. The stems will take a little longer to cook, so I generally start steaming these first, then after a few minutes add the florets and steam for another couple of minutes. When cooked, swirl the broccoli in icy water to chill. This will both stop the cooking and chill it for the salad. Drain and pat dry.</p>
<p>To make the dressing, mix mayonnaise, vinegar and honey together in a small bowl.</p>
<p>Combine broccoli, onion and cranberries. Pour in dressing and toss to coat. Sprinkle the almonds over the top just before serving. (The cranberries and onion have a habit of accumulating in the bottom of a large salad bowl, so take note to scoop these up as you&#8217;re serving the broccoli.)</p></p>

<p>Despite my best intentions, as usual I ate too much chocolate in too short a time over Easter. As a result, part of me is craving more chocolate and other junk, a craving I&#8217;m trying very hard to ignore. At the same time, when I&#8217;ve had too much sugar part of me also craves really fresh and ultra-healthy food, so I made up a big bowl of this buckwheat and chickpea tabouli for dinner last night. This isn&#8217;t just a salad for post-Easter detoxes though, it&#8217;s tasty, nutritious and refreshing and makes a great lunch or light dinner any time.</p>
<p>The recipe is a modification of one of Carol Fenster&#8217;s from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Gluten-Free-Vegetarian-Kitchen-Nutritious/dp/1557885109%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1557885109" target="_blank">The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen</a>. For a quicker option, or a vegan alternative, skip the egg and go straight to cooking the buckwheat in vegetable stock. Cooking the buckwheat with egg helps keep the grains separate so they don&#8217;t become mushy as cooked, so I like to do this when adding the buckwheat to salads.</p>
<p>Serves 5</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup buckwheat</li>
<li>1 egg, lightly whisked (optional)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon canola oil (only if using the egg)</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups vegetable stock (possibly a little more of&nbsp;omitting&nbsp;the egg)</li>
<li>1/2 cup dried chickpeas, soaked, cooked and drained, or 1 400g tin chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li>
<li>4 shallots/scallions, finely sliced</li>
<li>4 tomatoes, chopped, or a punnet of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>1/2 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>1/2 cup fresh mint, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice (juice of about half a lemon)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>3 cups lettuce leaves, coarsely chopped, or mixed greens</li>
</ul>
<p>To cook buckwheat using an egg: Heat the canola oil in a saucepan over a medium heat, and swirl so the oil coats the bottom of the saucepan. In a small bowl combine the buckwheat and egg, then transfer to saucepan. Cook, stirring frequently with a fork, until egg has dried and grains are separate, 5-10 minutes. Add a scant 1 1/2 cups vegetable stock, bring to the boil, and simmer until stock is absorbed and buckwheat tender, about 20 minutes. If liquid dries up before the buckwheat is cooked, add a little extra stock or hot water.</p>
<p>Alternatively, cook buckwheat without the egg: Add 1 1/2 cups stock and buckwheat to a saucepan over medium heat. Bring stock to the boil and simmer until stock is absorbed and buckwheat tender, about 25 minutes. &nbsp;If liquid dries up before the buckwheat is cooked, add a little extra stock or hot water.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, combine chickpeas, shallots, tomatoes, parsley and mint and a large bowl. Toss with a few pinches each of salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Combine vinegar, lemon juice and olive oil in a jar and shake well to emulsify.</p>
<p>When buckwheat is cooked, allow to cool slightly (unless you&#8217;re in a hurry), before adding to the bowl with the chickpeas and tomatoes. Toss to combine. The tomatoes and herbs will stay fresher if the buckwheat isn&#8217;t really hot when it&#8217;s added. Salad can be prepared up to here in advance.</p>
<p>Just before serving, pour dressing over the tabouli and mix through. Serve spooned over lettuce.</p></p>

<p>Quinoa was one of my best discoveries following my coeliac diagnosis. If I could start eating gluten tomorrow, quinoa would remain one of my staples. I really like the texture, plus quinoa is a great source of nutrients, especially protein. Quinoa is unusual for being a vegetarian complete protein, in fact it&#8217;s so nutritious the Incas revered quinoa as sacred and used it to sustain their armies.</p>
<p>This quinoa salad is modified from a recipe in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/1000-Gluten-Free-Recipes/dp/B00464EAVG%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00464EAVG">1000 Gluten Free Recipes</a> by Carol Fenster. It is slightly sweet and makes a lovely side or light meal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, omit the hazelnuts.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup quinoa</li>
<li>2 cups vegetable stock</li>
<li>Â½ cup hazelnuts, coarsely chopped and toasted</li>
<li>2 or 3 shallots/scallions, finely sliced</li>
<li>1 cup red seedless grapes, halved</li>
<li>2 cups coarsely chopped lettuce or mixed greens</li>
<li><a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/25/grape-hazelnut-and-quinoa-salad#fruitybalsamic">Fruity balsamic dressing (recipe below)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Cook the quinoa: bring 1Â½ cups of stock to the boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the quinoa. Cook until quinoa is tender but not mushy, about 15-20 minutes, adding extra stock as needed. I find it generally takes a bit under 2 cups, about 1Â¾ cups of liquid to cook 1 cup of quinoa. You can tell the quinoa is cooked because the little rings around the outside of the seed will start to separate from the central part. Allow quinoa to cool to room temperature, or chill in the fridge during warmer weather.</p>
<p>While the quinoa is cooking&nbsp;and cooling make the dressing and prepare the other ingredients.</p>
<p>Mix the quinoa with the grapes and shallots. Salad can be prepared up to here in advance and stored in the fridge.</p>
<p>Toss the salad with the dressing. Serve quinoa spooned over the lettuce or greens, and sprinkle hazelnuts over the top.</p>
<p><a name="fruitybalsamic"></a></p>
<p><strong>Fruity balsamic dressing</strong></p>
<p>Makes about â…” cup</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>Â¼ cup orange juice (juice of about Â½ an orange)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons strawberry jam</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>1Â½&nbsp;tablespoons canola oil</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped or minced</li>
<li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
<li>&nbsp;A few pinches salt</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:14px">Strip the thyme leaves from the stems and discard the stems.&nbsp;Combine all ingredients in a jar and shake to combine. If the jam is not&nbsp;dissolving, try microwaving the dressing (for maybe 15-30 seconds, depending on the power of your microwave) to soften the jam.&nbsp;Alternatively you could zap the jam for 10 seconds before adding it to the other ingredients. Final suggestion&nbsp;is to use a small&nbsp;electric blender instead of a jar for mixing, if you have something suitable.</span></p>

<p>This recipe came into being after I bought a batch of peaches which turned out to be horribly floury and inedible. Fortunately, even the most unappetising of peaches become a delicacy when cooked.</p>
<p>For vegan, dairy/lactose-free or nut-free versions, omit the chÃ¨vre or pine nuts respectively.</p>
<p>Serves 2</p>
<ul>
<li>2 peaches</li>
<li>1 tablespoon brandy</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>t tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>black pepper</li>
<li>50 g&nbsp;chÃ¨vre&nbsp;(goat cheese)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted*</li>
<li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
</ul>
<p>*It pays to be watchful when toasting pine nuts, once heated they can go from raw to black in the space of a minute or two.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (360 F). Halve the peaches, remove the stone, and slice into wedges. Toss with brandy, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Spread on a baking tray and cook for about 20 minutes, or until tender.</p>
<p>Spread baby spinach on serving plates, and top with the peach slices. Crumble the chÃ¨vre over the top, and sprinkle with pine nuts. There will probably be some syrup left in the bottom of the baking tray; drizzle this across the salad and serve.</p>
