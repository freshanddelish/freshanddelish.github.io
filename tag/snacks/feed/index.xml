<p>Deliciousness in a glass! I mean seriously, who needs junk food when you can make treats like this that are made with proper&nbsp;food and contain real nutrients while also making your taste buds super happy?!</p>
<p>For vegan and dairy/lactose free alternatives, use soy or other non-dairy&nbsp;milk and either skip the yoghurt or try replacing it with silken tofu or non-dairy yoghurt.</p>
<p>Serves 1</p>
<ul>
<li>1 banana, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
<li>¼ cup skim milk</li>
<li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
<li>2 tablespoons natural yoghurt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cocoa powder</li>
<li>½ cup ice blocks (adjust depending on how cold you&#8217;d like your smoothie, alternatively use frozen banana and skip the ice).</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Enjoy!</p>

<p>DOES NOT CONTAIN FROG</p>
<p>This snack idea is so simple I almost didn&#8217;t post it; doing so feels a bit like writing a recipe for a cup of tea. However, I&#8217;ve had at least five people ask me about this concoction in the space of a week so here it is.</p>
<p>I particularly like chia prepared this way because it&#8217;s an energy source that&#8217;s light enough that I can drink it then proceed to exercise 15 minutes later without feeling remotely ill &#8211; even if that exercise is teaching Body Attack with it&#8217;s tuck-jump-burpees. There are not many foods for which I can say the same.</p>
<p>Now for the credits: idea courtesy of my sister, and the name&#8230; inspired by my mother who came close to convincing her squad of swimmers,&nbsp;using post-exercise nutritional arguments,&nbsp;that she was in fact drinking frogs eggs!</p>
<p>Serves 1</p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons chia seeds (any colour)</li>
<li>juice of half a lemon or lime (if you like stronger citrus flavours, add juice from the whole fruit)</li>
<li>300mL water</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a jar. Secure lid and shake well. Shake a couple of times over the next 5-10 minutes so the chia doesn&#8217;t clump together too densely. Refrigerate or allow to sit for at least 30 minutes and you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>This is one of my favourite post-workout snacks. It&#8217;s something of a cross between an egg flip and a banana smoothie and has good doses of both carbohydrates and protein to assist in recovery. I like to make it in two flavours: chocolate or vanilla.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll make this in the morning, keep it in the fridge at work and find it&#8217;s still fine for evening consumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, skip the LSA. For a dairy/lactose free option, replace the milk with soy milk or other non-dairy milk and likewise skip the yoghurt or use a non-dairy alternative.</p>
<p>Makes 1 large serving</p>
<ul>
<li>1 banana</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1/2 cup milk</li>
<li>2 tablespoons natural or greek yoghurt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon LSA</li>
<li>2 teaspoons cocoa powder or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence (adjust to taste)</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. How easy is that?!</p>

<p>Okay, so to say this blog&#8217;s been neglected lately is something of an understatement. Sometimes life just gets in the way and there are only so many things you can keep up with at once. Well, life has settled down somewhat lately, and I&#8217;ve been getting a number of requests to start posting again, so here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been getting several enquiries around the gym about some of the concoctions I&#8217;m seen snacking on so I&#8217;ll start by sharing some of those. I eat these fruit and nut balls as a high energy-density &#8216;fast&#8217; food to keep me going during long training sessions. If I&#8217;m doing two classes back-to-back I generally need to eat in between or my blood sugar can drop too low, but I don&#8217;t have much time and need something light enough that I can keep working on straight away.</p>
<p><span>The ingredients are quite flexible, as long as the ratios of fruit and nuts are kept similar. I use dried dates (because they&#8217;re both very tasty and very cheap) and prunes (because they&#8217;re sticky and help hold everything together) as the base. Go ahead and experiment with whatever fruits and nuts you prefer, but I&#8217;d recommend keeping the prunes in as they&#8217;re a good culinary &#8216;glue&#8217;. Also don&#8217;t go overboard with the seeds, I find they don&#8217;t crush up and hold together as well as the nuts.&nbsp;The ingredients below are suggestions, I&#8217;ll typically choose just a few based on what&#8217;s in my pantry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;I make up a big batch of balls and keep them in the fridge, taking about 3 balls as a &#8216;serving&#8217;. I can attest to them lasting at least 3-4 weeks in the fridge, mine have never lasted longer as they&#8217;re all gone by then!</p>
<p>For a seasonal touch: these would also be a nice treat as part of a Christmas spread.</p>
<p><span>Makes approximately 3 dozen balls</span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup dried pitted dates</li>
<li>1 cup pitted prunes</li>
<li>1 cup mixed dried fruit (I like sultanas, cranberries, apricots, goji berries but feel free to try anything else)</li>
<li>2 cups mixed nuts and seeds (I like walnuts, cashews, blanched almonds, macadamias, hazelnuts, pepitas&#8230; the list goes on&#8230; but once again try whatever you like)</li>
<li>2/3 cup desiccated coconut</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients except coconut in a food processor and process until fruit and nuts are well chopped and mixture holds together well. If, like me, you&#8217;ve just dumped in all the fruit then all the nuts, or vice versa, you may need to stop the processor and stir the mixture up a bit to get it well combined then process a little longer. Or you could do the sensible thing and toss the fruit and nuts together first then process.</p>
<p><span>Put the coconut in a cereal bowl. Scoop out about a tablespoon of the fruit and nut mixture (enough to make a roughly 1 inch diameter ball). Roll into a ball between your hands then roll in the coconut to coat. Set aside and repeat until all the mixture has been used up. Try not to eat all at once and enjoy!</span></p>
