<p>I tend to get a little concerned when I hear the &#8216;vegetarian&#8217;Â conversationÂ going on in the background while I&#8217;m cooking. It goes something like this:Â my partner being quizzed by our dinner guest along the lines of &#8220;so are you vegetarian too?&#8221;, &#8220;do you always eat vegetarian meals?&#8221;, &#8220;do you mind not eating meat at home?&#8221;, &#8220;what about protein?&#8221;,Â etc., etc. Fast forward an hour or two and said guest has not only complemented the meal butÂ scraped his plate clean and even volunteered to do the washing up (actions speak louder than words)&#8230;Â I think maybe I&#8217;ve changed someone&#8217;s mind on vegetarian cooking!</p>
<p>This recipe came about by combining a mango and halloumiÂ saladÂ suggestion fromÂ my good friend Tegan, with a mango and avocado saladÂ recipe fromÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-All-About-Vegetarian/dp/B0002Y0SII%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0002Y0SII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joy of Cooking: All About Vegetarian Cooking</a>Â by Irma Rombauer et al., along with some tweaks of my own. If you&#8217;ve tried my recipes before, hopefully you&#8217;ve learned that even (or especially) when you read anÂ ingredients list and the words &#8220;unlikely combination&#8221; come to mind, the result is going to be good. If you&#8217;re new to my blog then trust me, this is worth being a little adventurous!</p>
<p>I often include eggs with the salad to turn in into a complete meal, but I also like serving it without the eggs alongside panfried fish or to add a bit of &#8216;wow&#8217; factor to a spread.Â The number of eggs is also easily varied according to appetite: after something slightly lighter?Â make it 1 egg per person, feeding a hungry man after a big training session?Â pile on some extra eggs and maybe add a side with more carbs.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, skip the macadamias. For a vegan and dairy/lactose free salad, leave out the eggs and halloumiÂ and the resulting mango and avocado salad is still a great combination!</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>Â½ cup macadamia nuts</li>
<li>1 lemon, juiced (around 3 tablespoonsÂ lemon juice)</li>
<li>2 avocados</li>
<li>2 small-medium mangoes or 1 large</li>
<li>Â½ red onion</li>
<li>2 orÂ 3 tablespoons olive oil (use 3 tablespoons if you&#8217;re including eggs, otherwise just use 2)</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>Â¼ cup fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 cups baby spinach</li>
<li>8 eggs (optional)</li>
<li>200g halloumi</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 160ËšC (320 F). Coarsely chop the macadamias then spread on a baking tray. Bake in oven until macadamias are fragrant and lightly toasted. If your oven is preheated this will only take 3-5 minutes, although they may need longer if the oven&#8217;s still heating up.Â Keep a close eye on them, nuts will generally go from raw to burnt very easily if you get distracted. Once the macadamias are toasted set them aside until you&#8217;re ready to serve.</p>
<p>Place half the lemon juice in a medium-sized bowl.Â Slice the avocados lengthwise and remove the stones. Score flesh into approximately 1cm pieces then scoop it away from the skin and place in the bowl of lemon juice. Toss to coat the avocado with lemon juice &#8211;Â this will help prevent browning (which is quite harmless butÂ aesthetically not very pleasing).</p>
<p>Cut the mango(es) into approximately 1 cm pieces and add to the avocado. Peel and finely slice the red onion; add it to the mango and avocado then toss to combine.</p>
<p>Make the dressing: combine 2 tablespoon olive oil, the remaining lemon juice, finely chopped basil and a pinch each of salt and pepper in a jar and shake to combine.</p>
<p>Divide baby spinach between serving plates and spoon avocado and mango mixture over the top.</p>
<p>If serving with eggs: depending on your frying pan you may need to cook the eggs in a few batches.Â Heat the remaining tablespoon (or for batches, portion there-of)Â of olive oilÂ in a frying pan over medium heat. Keeping the medium heat, fry the eggs for a 2-3 minutes on each side until light golden and cooked through. Serve alongside the salad and season with a little salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>Finally, cook the halloumi. This is very quick so I do it last after I&#8217;ve cooked the eggs. Use the frying pan from the eggs that&#8217;s still hot, or heat your frying pan over a hot stove then turn the heat down to medium. Placing halloumi into an already hot pan will ensure it forms a delicious golden crust while melting on the insideÂ (whereas if itÂ cooks too slowly you may end up with a blob of molten cheese in your pan).Â There&#8217;s generally enough fat in the halloumi that it doesn&#8217;t need extra oil for cooking, especially if you&#8217;re using a non-stick frying pan. Cook over a medium heat for about 1 minute on each side until halloumi is golden brown then server over the salad.</p>
<p>Give the dressing you made another shake to ensure it&#8217;s well mixed then drizzle over the salad. Sprinkle with macadamia nuts and you&#8217;re good to go. Happy Dinner! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>If visiting family interstate for a couple of weeks taught me something it&#8217;s this: eating out of someone else&#8217;s kitchen is the mother of culinary invention. If you&#8217;re travelling, house-sitting, or for whatever reasonÂ don&#8217;t have access to your favourite go-to ingredients, rather than getting frustrated or feeling defeatedÂ why not view it as an opportunity to get creative?Â It&#8217;s moments like these when some of my favourite meals come into being;Â I may not even know quite what I&#8217;m making until I&#8217;m almost done, I just start putting things together and see where the food leads me. In this case it was to a refreshing, satisfying and nutritious lunch. Can&#8217;t have too many yummyÂ salad ideas methinks.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version,Â skip the almonds and seeds if needs be.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>Spices as follow:
<ul>
<li>1 teaspoon ras el hanout</li>
<li>Â½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>Â½ teaspoon ground coriander seeds</li>
<li>Â¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>â…” cup quinoa</li>
<li>2 teaspoons canola oil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
<li>salt and pepper (optional, to taste)</li>
<li><a href="#limeyoghurt">Â¾ cupÂ lime-infused yoghurt (recipe below)</a></li>
<li>250g cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>4 cups leafy greens (I used baby spinach and baby kale but other greens,Â based on your preferences and availability,Â should also work;Â for larger leaves remove any tough or fibrous stems andÂ cut or tear the leavesÂ into bite sized pieces)</li>
<li>Â½ cup almonds, coarsely chopped and lightly toasted</li>
<li>2 teaspoon chia seeds</li>
<li>2 teaspoons linseeds</li>
</ul>
<p>Hard boil the eggs:Â Place eggs in a saucepan and add enough cold water to completely cover them. Bring water to a boil over a high heat then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 12Â minutes. Remove eggs and set aside to cool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile combine the spices in the bottom of a saucepan and heat gently until fragrant. Set aside about 1Â teaspoon of the spices but leave the rest in the saucepan.Â Add the quinoa and canola oil to the saucepan with the spicesÂ and stir to combine. Cook over a medium heat, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat for 5 minutes (this will allow it to cool a bit so it doesn&#8217;t hiss tooÂ much and spit your quinoa out of theÂ when you add water). Add 1Â¼Â cups water to the saucepan, stir to mix with the quinoa,Â and return to the stove. Simmer over a low heat until water is absorbed and quinoa just cooked, adding a little extra water if needed. The quinoa will be cooked when the little rings start to separate from the central seed.</p>
<p>Once the eggs are cool enough to handle you can peel them (this can also be done under running cold water while the eggs are still hot): tap all sidesÂ against a hard surface, like your kitchen bench, to crack the shell then peel it away; getting under the thin &#8216;skin&#8217; between the egg and shell will make it easier to peel the shell away.</p>
<p>Cut the eggs into about 1 cm (Â½ inch) chunks. In a small bowl, toss the eggs with theÂ teaspoon of spices you set aside earlier, the olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper, if using. Add eggs to the quinoa along with the tomatoes and toss to combine.</p>
<p>To serve, divide leafy greens between bowls then top with quinoa salad. Spoon the lime-infused yoghurt over the top andÂ sprinkle with the almonds, chia seeds and linseeds. Toss or mix it all together to eat!</p>
<h2 id="limeyoghurt">Lime-infused yoghurt</h2>
<p>Makes about Â¾ cup</p>
<ul>
<li>1 lime</li>
<li>â…“ cup fresh mint leaves</li>
<li>â…” cup natural yoghurt</li>
<li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the finest side of your grater or a microplane to zest the lime;Â then juice the lime. Finely chop the mint. Combine mint, lime zest and juice and yoghurt in a small bowl and mix to combine. Season with a pinch or two of pepper, to taste.</p>

<p>Despite being fairly confident that&nbsp;there would be plenty of food&nbsp;I agreed to add an extra dish,&nbsp;opting&nbsp;for a leafy salad to complement the already substantial meal.&nbsp;As it turns out, we were still polishing off the left overs three days later!&nbsp;(Admittedly&nbsp;left-overs <em>are</em> almost compulsory following Christmas lunch.) In this case it definitely&nbsp;worked out for the best because this creation is really very good&nbsp;(am I allowed to say that about my own recipe?)</p>
<p>Back home and through the process of testing the recipe this salad&nbsp;has rapidly become a favourite. Only thing is, there are two versions and I can&#8217;t decide which I like best, so I&#8217;ve included both options and you can choose for yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question before you is this: pomegranate or cranberries? The pomegranate seeds are refreshing and add a nice crunch. The cranberries are sweeter and slightly chewy. I like both versions. I&#8217;d suggest the pomegranate&nbsp;as a nice refreshing choice&nbsp;on a&nbsp;warm day, and the cranberries when you&#8217;re looking to bring a little more sweetness to the meal. Dried cranberries are also typically easier to come by than fresh pomegranates.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t included rocket in my leafy greens.&nbsp;Personally I don&#8217;t like rocket&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;I find it too hot &#8211;&nbsp;while the watercress here is just a little peppery.&nbsp;If you are a fan of rocket&nbsp;I suspect if would work well in this salad, and I always encourage experimentation when cooking.</p>
<p>For a nut free version, skip the almonds. It won&#8217;t be as crunchy but the combination of flavours should still survive. For a vegan or dairy/lactose-free alternative, omit the parmesan.</p>
<p>Serves 4 as a side</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups baby kale</li>
<li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
<li>1 cup watercress leaves, removed from stems</li>
<li>Â½ cup almonds</li>
<li>1 pomegranate or Â½ cup dried cranberries</li>
<li>Â½ cup shaved parmesan</li>
<li>Â½ red onion, finely sliced or diced</li>
<li><a href="#">â…“ cup mustard Vinaigrette (recipe below)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If using a&nbsp;pomegranate, start by seeding the fruit (otherwise, skip straight to the next paragraph). Tori&nbsp;Avey provides some great instructions explaining&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/2011/09/how-to-seed-a-pomegranate/#recipe">How to Seed a Pomegranate</a>. (Tori&#8217;s post also includes instructions for juicing a pomegranate &#8211; don&#8217;t go that far here, for this salad you want to keep the seeds whole.)</p>
<p>Place kale, spinach and&nbsp;watercress&nbsp;in a large salad bowl and toss to mix. Pour mustard vinaigrette over the top&nbsp;and toss again so the greens are well coated with&nbsp;the dressing. Add the almonds, pomegranate or cranberries, parmesan and onion. Toss to combine all ingredients and serve straight away.</p>
<p><a name="mustardvinaigrette"></a></p>
<p><strong>Mustard Vinaigrette</strong></p>
<p>Makes a little over&nbsp;â…“ cup</p>
<ul>
<li>Â½ lemon, juiced (around 1Â½ tablespoons lemon juice)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dijon mustard</li>
<li>2 teaspoons white wine vinegar</li>
<li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>pinch each of&nbsp;salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a jar,&nbsp;(ensure the lid is properly secured,)&nbsp;and shake well to combine.</p>

<p>Like many cooking enthusiasts I spent the days leading up to Christmas planning lunch for Christmas day, with little thought given to Christmas eve. &#8220;I&#8217;ll throw something quick together&#8221; I thought. Christmas eve night arrives and I find my self staying with my sister, who mentions a mate&#8217;s helping her out with something and could we feed him too please? Okay, so now I&#8217;m in someone else&#8217;s kitchen, with someone else&#8217;s pantry and we&#8217;ve got guests for dinner. Oh dear. A quick (read &#8216;frantic&#8217;) rummage through lil&#8217; sis&#8217; supplies and ideas are starting to form. This is what I came up with and it was good enough to warrant photos and a recipe request from lil&#8217; sis.</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding this meal did not lend themselves to highly specific ingredient requirements; i.e. go ahead and vary it up depending on what&#8217;s on hand and your own tastes.</p>
<p>If using store-bought pesto be sure to check the ingredients list for allergens or intolerances, and for vegan/nut-free versions skip the fetta/walnuts respectively too.</p>
<p>Serves 5</p>
<ul>
<li>1Â½ cups brown rice</li>
<li>1 small sweet potato</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
<li>250g swiss brown mushrooms</li>
<li>1 bunch asparagus</li>
<li>250g cherry tomatoes</li>
<li>1 tin borlotti beans, rinsed and drained (or Â½ cup dried borlotti beans, soaked overnight, cooked and drained)</li>
<li>Â½ cup fresh basil, roughly chopped</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>200g sundried tomato pesto</li>
<li>5 cups baby spinach</li>
<li>125g fetta</li>
<li>â…” cup walnuts, lightly toasted and coarsely chopped</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ÂºC (350 F). Line a baking tray with baking paper.</p>
<p>Place the rice in a medium saucepan along with 2Â½ cups water. Bring to the boil over a high heat then reduce heat and simmer until rice is tender and water absorbed, about 30 minutes. (If saucepan dries out before the rice is cooked add a little more water.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, peel the sweet potato and cut into cubes (approximately 1Â½ cm or Â½ inch in size). Toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil then spread evenly on the baking tray. Bake in preheated oven until slightly golden and soft in the middle, about 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Now for the mushrooms and asparagus. Slice the mushrooms about Â½ cm (Â¼ inch) thick; finely dice or crush the garlic; cut any tough ends off the asparagus and cut into bite-sized pieces. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat and add the garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes until garlic is fragrant then add the mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally until mushrooms just start to brown lightly. Add the asparagus and cook for a few more minutes until asparagus is heated through and mushrooms are golden.</p>
<p>Set the mushrooms aside heat another tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook over a medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes to cook the tomatoes. Use a spatula to lightly crush the tomatoes in the pan, just enough to split the skins and release some juice. Add the borlotti beans, basil and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes to heat through and thicken up some of the tomato juices.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s most of the preparation done. To put it all together transfer the rice to a large bowl and stir through the pesto. Add the sweet potato, the mushroom and asparagus mix and the tomatoes and borlotti beans and mix it all together.</p>
<p>To serve, divide baby spinach between bowls and spoon rice mixture over the top. Top with toasted walnuts and crumbled fetta. Happy dinner!</p>

<p>Summer has arrived and doesn&#8217;t the warmer weather just make it so much easier to eat well?! Here&#8217;s another idea for a refreshing and tasty salad to enjoy and feel good about. To my readers in the Northern hemisphere, the key fruit and vegetables: oranges, carrots and leafy greens, are in season during winter too, and it&#8217;s never the wrong time of year to eat well!</p>
<p>This salad is super fresh and simply dressed, it&#8217;s all about letting quality ingredients shine through. So, a few pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the slightly saggy week-old carrots sitting in the bottom of your fridge&#8217;s crisper for stock or juice and buy (or dig!) a fresh bunch.</li>
<li>Now&#8217;s the time to splash out on good quality tofu; you&#8217;re not going to be cooking it or hiding it under any sauces here so it&#8217;s worth an extra couple of dollars for the organic option.</li>
<li>When I used to think of olive oil&nbsp;I thought of Italy, but it turns out Australia produces its own great olive oils here at home. In fact, my favourite: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homeleighgroveolives.com.au/index.html">Homeleigh Grove&#8217;s</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homeleighgroveolives.com.au/OliveProducts.htm">&#8216;Lowanna&#8217;s Paddock&#8217;</a>, a Robust extra virgin olive oil,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.irvea.org/in-evidenza/nz-sa-2014-awards-ceremony/">was recently awarded first place in a Southern hemisphere international competition</a>! So next time you&#8217;re shopping for olive oil, why not try buying local: if you&#8217;re lucky enough to have a farmers&#8217; market near by, that&#8217;s a good bet, otherwise IGA supermarkets are pretty good at stocking local products too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did I mention fresh was the key here?&nbsp;I&#8217;m a bit proud of our little veggie garden lately which has become quite productive; you can&#8217;t get much fresher than picked 15 minutes ago!&nbsp;In case you were wondering, here&#8217;s the before photo: spring harvest of homegrown parsley, carrots and kale&#8230;</p>
<p>      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/img.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This salad is good prepared and served straight away, but if you&#8217;re the oranised type it doesn&#8217;t hurt to let the tofu &#8216;marinate&#8217; with the oranges and herbs in the fridge for a few hours &#8211; just see the guidelines in the recipe below.</p>
<p>If seeds may be an allergen for you or someone you&#8217;re feeding, just leave them off the salad, the fresh carrots will still add a nice crunch. The basil is a nice addition and works well with the other flavours, but I&#8217;ve also made it with just the parsley if I haven&#8217;t had basil on hand.</p>
<p>Serves 5</p>
<ul>
<li>400-500g firm tofu</li>
<li>3 navel oranges (other varieties will work too, just be sure to remove the pips)</li>
<li>Small bunch parsley (approximately 1 cup, loosely packed)</li>
<li>Optional: a few sprigs fresh basil (approximately Â½ cup, loosely packed)</li>
<li>1 bunch baby (also known as &#8216;Dutch&#8217;) carrots (regular &#8216;adult&#8217; carrots will work too, if that&#8217;s what&#8217;s available)</li>
<li>1 bunch kale, silverbeet, spinach or other dark leafy green</li>
<li>2 teaspoons poppy seeds</li>
<li>â…“ heaped cup pepitas (pumpkin seeds)</li>
<li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>Cut the tofu into 1 cm &nbsp;(Â½ inch) cubes and place in a large&nbsp;bowl. Peel the oranges, cut into bite-sized pieces and add to the tofu. Remove the parsley and basil (if using) leaves from their stems. (You can discard the stems).&nbsp;Finely chop the&nbsp;leaves and add to the tofu and oranges. Add just a few pinches each of salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.&nbsp;Mix well to combine ingredients.&nbsp;If you&#8217;re preparing this in advance stop here, cover and store in the fridge until you&#8217;re just about ready to serve.</p>
<p>Cut the carrots into small pieces (less than 1 cm, or about Â¼ inch in size). Toss through the salad.</p>
<p>Remove any tough, fibrous stems from your leafy greens. Coarsely chop or tear the leaves and use these to line serving bowls. Spoon the tofu mix over the greens and&nbsp;drizzle with olive oil (a few teaspoons per serve). Finally, sprinkle with poppy seeds (about Â½ teaspoon per serve) and pepitas (about 1 tablespoon per serve). Important: don&#8217;t add the seeds until you&#8217;re ready to serve the salad, it will keep them nice and crunchy. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;and welcome to the latest episode of &#8216;What&#8217;s Left in the Fridge at the End of the Week?&#8217; And the answer is: carrots, chestnuts, a bunch of silverbeet and some lemons. The lemons are still in the fridge, everything else went into this surprisingly successful creation that I&#8217;ll definitely be making again.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped or crushed</li>
<li>6 sprigs thyme</li>
<li>6 sage leaves, finely chopped</li>
<li>1/4 tsp cumin seeds</li>
<li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
<li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>2 bunches carrots</li>
<li>500g chestnuts</li>
<li>Â½&nbsp;cup parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 red onion, finely diced</li>
<li>Large bunch silverbeet</li>
<li>1 cup cashews, roasted</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350F).</p>
<p>Place cumin seeds in a skillet and cook over a low heat until they become fragrant. Don&#8217;t leave them unattended for long because they&#8217;ll quickly go from lightly toasted to burnt; I&#8217;d suggest removing the seeds from the heat when their scent becomes stronger, rather than waiting for them to appear brown.</p>
<p>Remove leaves from thyme and discard the stems. In a small bowl combine the thyme and sage leaves, garlic, cumin seeds, honey, sherry, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch each of salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Cut the carrots into sticks approximately 1 cm (Â½ &nbsp;inch) thick and toss through the spiced oil you just mixed up. Spread in a baking dish&nbsp;and bake until just tender, about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile roast and peel the chestnuts: Use a Stanley knife to cut a slice through the top (the pointy&nbsp;end) of each chestnut. Place on a tray and bake for 15-20 minutes until the skin starts to look a little crinkly or to split. Remove only a cup or so of&nbsp;chestnuts from the oven at a time as they&#8217;re easiest to peel while still quite hot. Peel the outer shell and inner skin from each chestnut.&nbsp;I wear a rubber glove on one hand but leave the other free as a balance between not getting burnt and maintaining a degree of dexterity.</p>
<p>Add chestnuts to the dish roasted carrots along with parsley and red onion. Toss to combine then return to the oven for about 5 minutes while you prepare the silverbeet.</p>
<p>Remove the stems from the silverbeet and coarsely chop the leaves. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the silverbeet and toss to coat with&nbsp;the oil. Cook, stirring frequently,&nbsp;until just wilted (if the oil is already hot this will only take a minute or two).&nbsp;Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re ready to serve: Divide the silverbeet between plates or bowls. Top with&nbsp;carrots and chestnuts and sprinkle with roasted cashews.</p>

<p>DOES NOT CONTAIN FROG</p>
<p>This snack idea is so simple I almost didn&#8217;t post it; doing so feels a bit like writing a recipe for a cup of tea. However, I&#8217;ve had at least five people ask me about this concoction in the space of a week so here it is.</p>
<p>I particularly like chia prepared this way because it&#8217;s an energy source that&#8217;s light enough that I can drink it then proceed to exercise 15 minutes later without feeling remotely ill &#8211; even if that exercise is teaching Body Attack with it&#8217;s tuck-jump-burpees. There are not many foods for which I can say the same.</p>
<p>Now for the credits: idea courtesy of my sister, and the name&#8230; inspired by my mother who came close to convincing her squad of swimmers,&nbsp;using post-exercise nutritional arguments,&nbsp;that she was in fact drinking frogs eggs!</p>
<p>Serves 1</p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons chia seeds (any colour)</li>
<li>juice of half a lemon or lime (if you like stronger citrus flavours, add juice from the whole fruit)</li>
<li>300mL water</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a jar. Secure lid and shake well. Shake a couple of times over the next 5-10 minutes so the chia doesn&#8217;t clump together too densely. Refrigerate or allow to sit for at least 30 minutes and you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>It is possible to overdose on parsley? This is the question my partner&#8217;s been asking as he shares his suspicions that I&#8217;m trying to poison him with the herb, we&#8217;ve been eating that much of it lately! No, I don&#8217;t have a weird parsley obsession or craving (and I most certainly am not trying to poison anyone), we just have two parsley plants that are on a mission to take over the world, starting with our veggie garden. In a battle that&#8217;s been ongoing for several months now, I&#8217;m starting to get the upper hand, in large part thanks to regular batches of <a href="#parsleypesto">parsley pesto</a>.</p>
<p>I was quite proud of these <a href="#stuffedcapsicums">stuffed capsicums</a> because they centred around ingredients picked fresh from our garden: the parsley, of course, and also the sage and this delightful harvest of capsicums:</p>
<p>      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Capsicumparselyharvest1editedresized.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Enjoy these stuffed capsicums by themselves or pair with a dose of protein, perhaps eggs or baked fish, for a complete meal.&nbsp;If you&#8217;re entertaining, the capsicums can be prepared and stuffed in advance. Store them in the fridge in an airtight container. Take them out an hour or so before baking so they can come to room temperature, or allow a bit of extra baking time if they&#8217;re still cold.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, omit the walnuts when making the pesto. For a vegan or dairy free version, the pesto is still very good without the parmesan (and I&#8217;ll sometimes make it without cheese if we&#8217;ve run out at home).</p>
<h3 id="stuffedcapsicums">Stuffed Capsicums</h3>
<p>Serves 4 as a side or light meal</p>
<ul>
<li>4 capsicums</li>
<li>â…“ cup brown rice</li>
<li>1 brown onion, diced</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely diced or chopped</li>
<li>6 leaves fresh sage, finely chopped</li>
<li>Â¼ cup currants</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>â…“ cup <a href="#parsleypesto">parsley pesto (recipe below)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350F). Brush a baking dish large enough to hold all the capsicums lightly with olive oil.</p>
<p>Add the brown rice and Â¾ cup water to a saucepan and bring to the boil over a medium heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer until water is absorbed and rice tender, adding a little more water during cooking if needed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, behead the capsicums (i.e. slice the tops off so you have the capsicum with a &#8216;lid&#8217;). Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds; rinsing under running water can also help clear away loose seeds. Set aside for later use.</p>
<p>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pay over medium head and add the onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until onion softens. Add the garlic and sage and cook for another minute or two.</p>
<p>In a bowl stir together the onion mixture, rice, currants, and parsley pesto. Taste and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>Spoon stuffing into the capsicums and top with the lids. If you have left over filling it makes a tasty snack or part of lunch the next day. Arrange capsicums in the baking dish and bake until capsicums are cooked and stuffing is heated through, about 30 minutes. Enjoy!</p>
<h3 id="parsleypesto">Parsley Pesto</h3>
<p>Makes about 3/4 cup</p>
<ul>
<li>large bunch flat-leaf parsley</li>
<li>1/4 cup walnuts, toasted</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, unpeeled</li>
<li>3-6 tablespoons olive oil (exact quantity will depend on how much parsley you have and on the blender you&#8217;re using).</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350F) and roast garlic for about 20 minutes, until tender.</p>
<p>Add parsley and 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil to a blender or small food processor (I&#8217;ve found my stick blender works best). Process until finely chopped and if parsley does not blend well add more oil. You may also need to stop the blender and scrape down the sides.</p>
<p>Peel the garlic and add it, the walnuts and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Process until you have a paste-like consistency.</p>
<p>Add the parmesan and process briefly to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</p>
<p>This will keep stored in the fridge for about a week. The colour may darken a little but it still tastes just as good.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;It was a dark and stormy night during a miserably cold winter. Fortunately, thanks to Fresh &amp; delish, they had the cosiest comfort food ever to warm them.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Okay, so please keep reading to discover that my culinary skills really are better than my somewhat lacking literary talents. This is absolutely one of my favourite meals for a cold stormy night; pair it with some warm mulled wine and you&#8217;re all set to beat the winter chills.</p>
<p>The <a href="#wildricequinoapilaf">wild rice &amp; quinoa pilaf</a> is based on a recipe out of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/1000-Gluten-Free-Recipes/dp/B00464EAVG%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00464EAVG">1000 Gluten-Free Recipes</a>, but I&#8217;ve been making the <a href="#bakedricotta">baked ricotta</a> long enough that I can&#8217;t recall where the idea came from to properly acknowledge it. The ricotta and pilaf can also be made separately as accompaniments to other dishes, but the combination is my epitome of comfort food.</p>
<p>For this meal I usually get the rice cooking, then prepare the ricotta, and move the pilaf and ricotta to the oven at about the same time. Fresh ricotta has a very short shelf life so don&#8217;t buy it more than a day in advance or it may go sour.</p>
<p>For a nut free version, simply skip the almonds.</p>
<h2 id="wildricequinoapilaf">Wild rice and quinoa pilaf</h2>
<p><span>Serves 4-5 as a side</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>3/4 cup wild rice</span></li>
<li><span>3/4 cup quinoa (black or red is most visually appealing, but all varieties work equally well in terms of flavour)</span></li>
<li><span>3 cups vegetable stock (powdered is okay, just start with less powder than suggested as it is often very salty)</span></li>
<li><span>1/4 cup dried cranberries</span></li>
<li><span>1/4 cup sultanas</span></li>
<li><span>1 tablespoon olive oil</span></li>
<li><span>1/2 cup flaked or slivered almonds, toasted</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Preheat oven to 180ËšC. Combine wild rice and stock in a saucepan and simmer, covered, over a medium heat for 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>If serving with baked ricotta, prepare that now then place in the oven at the same time as the pilaf.</span></p>
<p><span>Brush a cast iron or ceramic baking dish with olive oil.</span></p>
<p><span>Add the quinoa and dried fruit to the wild rice and stock, and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to the baking dish. Cover with a lid if available, otherwise with alfoil pricked in a few places to let excess steam out.</span></p>
<p><span>Bake until rice and quinoa are tender and liquid is absorbed, 45-60 minutes. If the dish dries out before the rice and quinoa are fully cooked just add a little more stock or water.</span></p>
<p><span>Serve spooned over the baked ricotta, and scatter almonds over the top.</span></p>
<h2 id="bakedricotta">Baked ricotta</h2>
<p>Serves 4 as a side</p>
<ul>
<li>500g ricotta</li>
<li><span>2 tablespoons olive oil</span></li>
<li><span>2-4 teaspoons dried herbs or 2-4 tablespoons fresh finely chopped herbs*</span></li>
<li><span>Pinch of pepper</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;*Feel free to try different combinations of herbs and spices depending on what you&#8217;re serving the ricotta with. Personally I&#8217;m a fan of Scarborough Fair&#8217;s parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme, which pairs well with the pilaf. For some other ideas, how about oregano and basil ricotta topped with <a target="_blank" href="/2013/05/08/2013-4-30-spanakopita-filled-chickpea-crepes#tomatosauce">tomato sauce</a>? Or mixing some toasted cumin and coriander seeds and a little ground cinnamon into the ricotta and serving with a <a target="_blank" href="/2013/04/01/2013-3-30-chickpea-tagine-with-morrocan-quinoa-pilaf#chickpeatagine">chickpea tagine</a>? Perhaps replace the cinnamon with ground cloves or cardamon and pair with an indian curry? The possibilities are endless, and baked ricotta is versatile enough that it really is very hard to ruin.</p>
<p><span>Preheat oven to 180ËšC (350 F) and brush a small (around 1-1.2 L) baking dish with olive oil.</span></p>
<p><span>Wrap ricotta in paper towel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any excess liquid. Transfer to a mixing bowl and add pepper and dried or chopped herbs. Mix well to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed; I like to add a little black pepper but find the cheese generally doesn&#8217;t need any added salt.</span></p>
<p>Spoon ricotta into prepared baking dish and use the back of a dessert spoon to press down and flatten out until it is evenly spread over the dish. Transfer to the oven and bake until the top is a light golden-brown colour, about 45-60 minutes. Cut into slices and serve.</p>
