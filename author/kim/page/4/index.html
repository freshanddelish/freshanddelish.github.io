<p>This is one of those dishes that you look at and ask &#8220;umm, really?&#8221; but yes, this really does work. The sweetness of the pumpkin and dates and the saltiness of the halloumi and pistachios complement each other perfectly, and the result is simply delectable. While I would like to be able to claim credit for the idea of cooking quinoa in peppermint tea, it actually came from a cous cous recipe in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tea-Cookbook-Savory-Recipes-Lovers/dp/B0064XC8AM%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0064XC8AM" target="_blank">Tea Cookbook</a> by Tonia George.</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, just omit the pistachios</p>
<p>Serves 4-5</p>
<ul>
<li>1 small-medium butternut pumpkin, half cut into 2cm cubes, and the other half sliced into roughly 1cm x 3cm x 10cm slices (or keep things simple and just cube the whole lot).</li>
<li>1 head garlic, kept whole</li>
<li>1 cup quinoa</li>
<li>2 cups peppermint tea (that&#8217;s 2 cups of prepared tea, NOT 2 cups of tea leaves!)</li>
<li>10 fresh dates, pitted and finely diced</li>
<li>1/4 cup pistachios, coarsely chopped and toasted</li>
<li>250g halloumi cheese, cut into 5mm thick slices</li>
<li>6 bay leaves</li>
<li>6 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180˚C (350 F). Lightly grease two baking trays with a olive oil. Spread cubed pumpkin on one baking tray and add the head of garlic. Toss with a little more olive oil, season with pepper and distribute half the bay leaves and thyme over the pumpkin. Arrange sliced pumpkin on the other tray, drizzle over a little extra olive oil, season with pepper and add remaining herbs. Bake until pumpkin and garlic are tender, and pumpkin is lightly brown. Turn the pumpkin half way through cooking. I find the total time to roast a tray of pumpkin and garlic like this is about 30 minutes, however with two trays our oven cooks much more slowly and it can take 40-50 minutes. (If I&#8217;m getting really impatient I&#8217;ll turn the oven up to 200˚C/390F to brown the pumpkin.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cook the quinoa: Combine quinoa and 1 3/4 cups of the peppermint tea in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to the boil. Reduce heat and simmer until tea is absorbed and quinoa tender. If needed, add a little extra tea or hot water while cooking. You can tell the quinoa is cooked because the little rings around the outside of the seed will start to separate from the central part.</p>
<p>Mix together quinoa, cubed pumpkin (or half, if you&#8217;ve cubed the whole lot) and dates. Squeeze out the roast garlic. The easiest way I&#8217;ve found to do this is to slice off the bottom of the garlic head and, wearing rubber gloves (especially if the garlic is still hot) squeeze until all the garlic comes out. Mix this into quinoa.</p>
<p>Cook the halloumi: Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. You want the pan to be nice and hot before you add the halloumi, so that the surface browns before the cheese melts into a blob. Unless you&#8217;re using a non-stick frying pan (or if you are but the teflon coating is starting to go), you may like to add a very small amount of olive oil to coat the pan. If you do use oil, do so sparingly&nbsp;because the halloumi will release its own fat as it cooks. Add the halloumi and cook until lightly golden brown on the underside, only 1-2 minutes. Turn over, and cook until the other side is also golden, about another minute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To serve: Spoon quinoa mix into bowls, top with pumpkin slices and halloumi and sprinkle pistachios over the top.</p></p>

<p>Despite my best intentions, as usual I ate too much chocolate in too short a time over Easter. As a result, part of me is craving more chocolate and other junk, a craving I&#8217;m trying very hard to ignore. At the same time, when I&#8217;ve had too much sugar part of me also craves really fresh and ultra-healthy food, so I made up a big bowl of this buckwheat and chickpea tabouli for dinner last night. This isn&#8217;t just a salad for post-Easter detoxes though, it&#8217;s tasty, nutritious and refreshing and makes a great lunch or light dinner any time.</p>
<p>The recipe is a modification of one of Carol Fenster&#8217;s from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Gluten-Free-Vegetarian-Kitchen-Nutritious/dp/1557885109%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1557885109" target="_blank">The Gluten-Free Vegetarian Kitchen</a>. For a quicker option, or a vegan alternative, skip the egg and go straight to cooking the buckwheat in vegetable stock. Cooking the buckwheat with egg helps keep the grains separate so they don&#8217;t become mushy as cooked, so I like to do this when adding the buckwheat to salads.</p>
<p>Serves 5</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup buckwheat</li>
<li>1 egg, lightly whisked (optional)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon canola oil (only if using the egg)</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups vegetable stock (possibly a little more of&nbsp;omitting&nbsp;the egg)</li>
<li>1/2 cup dried chickpeas, soaked, cooked and drained, or 1 400g tin chickpeas, rinsed and drained</li>
<li>4 shallots/scallions, finely sliced</li>
<li>4 tomatoes, chopped, or a punnet of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>1/2 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>1/2 cup fresh mint, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice (juice of about half a lemon)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>3 cups lettuce leaves, coarsely chopped, or mixed greens</li>
</ul>
<p>To cook buckwheat using an egg: Heat the canola oil in a saucepan over a medium heat, and swirl so the oil coats the bottom of the saucepan. In a small bowl combine the buckwheat and egg, then transfer to saucepan. Cook, stirring frequently with a fork, until egg has dried and grains are separate, 5-10 minutes. Add a scant 1 1/2 cups vegetable stock, bring to the boil, and simmer until stock is absorbed and buckwheat tender, about 20 minutes. If liquid dries up before the buckwheat is cooked, add a little extra stock or hot water.</p>
<p>Alternatively, cook buckwheat without the egg: Add 1 1/2 cups stock and buckwheat to a saucepan over medium heat. Bring stock to the boil and simmer until stock is absorbed and buckwheat tender, about 25 minutes. &nbsp;If liquid dries up before the buckwheat is cooked, add a little extra stock or hot water.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, combine chickpeas, shallots, tomatoes, parsley and mint and a large bowl. Toss with a few pinches each of salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Combine vinegar, lemon juice and olive oil in a jar and shake well to emulsify.</p>
<p>When buckwheat is cooked, allow to cool slightly (unless you&#8217;re in a hurry), before adding to the bowl with the chickpeas and tomatoes. Toss to combine. The tomatoes and herbs will stay fresher if the buckwheat isn&#8217;t really hot when it&#8217;s added. Salad can be prepared up to here in advance.</p>
<p>Just before serving, pour dressing over the tabouli and mix through. Serve spooned over lettuce.</p></p>

<p>Figs are in season and abundant at the Farmers&#8217; Market; as I adore fresh figs I find this very exciting. Having bought two bags of figs at the markets last weekend, I recalled fondly some very tasty fig and brie mini pizzas I made for a dinner party a few years ago. I wanted a healthier option to the pizza base though, so paired the toppings with some linseed meal crackers. The only thing is, I need your help to name them. The best I can come up with is &#8216;Toasted fig, brie, balsamic caramelised&nbsp;onion and walnut linseed slices&#8217; which, while descriptive, is a little long. So, have a go at making these and suggest a new name in the comments section.</p>
<p>Makes about 20</p>
<p>Linseed crackers:</p>
<ul>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>2 cups linseed meal</li>
<li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>a few pinches pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped, or 1/2 teaspoon dried</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon dried sage</li>
</ul>
<p>Toppings:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>3 red onions, sliced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon golden syrup or honey</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>10 fresh figs, quartered</li>
<li>100g brie, cut into 20 wedges</li>
<li>1/2 cup walnuts, broken into pieces or coarsely chopped</li>
</ul>
<p>Make the linseed crackers:</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 180˚C (350 F), and lightly oil one large or two smaller baking tray(s). Combine all ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Stir in 1 cup water. Spread mix over the tray(s) and top with a sheet of baking paper. Use a rolling pin to roll out the mixture until it is about 5mm thick. Press in the edges so they are not too much thinner than the middle or else they&#8217;ll burn before the rest firms up. Remove the paper and bake in the oven until crackers are firm on the surface (they&#8217;ll still be a bit soft in the middle, but will harden as they cool), and starting to brown around the edges, 15-20 minutes.</p>
<p>Score into squares and use a spatula to remove crackers to a cooling rack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, caramelise the onions:</p>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and add the onions. Cook until the onions soften and begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in the vinegar and golden syrup or honey. Cook until onions are very soft and liquid has thickened, maybe another 15-20 minutes. Taste and adjust with a little extra vinegar or sweetener as needed.</p>
<p>To complete:</p>
<p>Return linseed crackers to the baking tray. Top each cracker with a heaped tablespoon of caramelised onion, two fig quarters, a slice of brie and finally a teaspoon of walnut pieces. Bake at 180˚C until brie has melted and walnuts are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Enjoy immediately.</p>

<p>This dish was inspired by a <a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/fishtagine_72361" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/fishtagine_72361" target="_blank">fish tagine</a> I tried a few months ago. I was really taken by the combination of flavours: it&#8217;s quite sweet from the dried fruit, heavy with spices and brightened by the lemon. I didn&#8217;t think the &#8216;fishiness&#8217; worked in it though, so I turned it into a chickpea tagine with much better results.</p>
<p>The tagine is paired here with a simple <a data-cke-saved-href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/30/chickpea-tagine-with-morrocan-quinoa-pilaf#morrocanquinoapilaf" href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/30/chickpea-tagine-with-morrocan-quinoa-pilaf#morrocanquinoapilaf">Moroccan quinoa pilaf (recipe below)</a>, but you could also serve with cous cous (if you can have gluten), rice or a flat bread instead.</p>
<p>The tagine keeps well in the fridge; I made a large batch of it last weekend and ate it for lunch for several days thereafter.</p>

<h3 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1405597876029_15036">Chickpea tagine</h3>
<p>Serves 8</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked, cooked and drained (or 2 400g tins of chickpeas, rinsed and drained)</li>
<li>spices (see below)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>3 medium sized onions, about 1/2 kg, grated (if you have a food processor with grater attachment this is the perfect job for it, if not you may prefer to just finely chop the onions instead &#8211; grating onions by hand is not fun)</li>
<li>1 bulb garlic, cloves separated, peeled and finely chopped or crushed</li>
<li>1 kg tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped* (or 800g tinned chopped tomatoes)</li>
<li>175g turkish dried apricots, halved</li>
<li>85g (1/2 cup) flaked almonds, lightly toasted&nbsp;</li>
<li>50g (1/3 cup) sultanas</li>
<li>1 teaspoon saffron stems</li>
<li>2 cups (500ml) tomato juice</li>
<li>1 cup vegetable stock</li>
<li>1 tablespoon honey (or agave nectar or sugar for a vegan alternative)</li>
<li>rind of 1 lemon, finely chopped</li>
<li>1/3 cup fresh coriander leaves, finely chopped</li>
<li>8 large lettuce leaves (or about 4 large handfuls mixed greens)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>*The Former Chef blog provides a good set of instructions on&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="http://www.formerchef.com/2009/08/20/how-to-peel-and-seed-fresh-tomatoes/" href="http://www.formerchef.com/2009/08/20/how-to-peel-and-seed-fresh-tomatoes/">How to Peel and Seed Tomatoes</a>.</p>
<p>Spices**:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons ras el hanout</li>
<li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground tumeric</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground coriander seed</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>**My spice rack is fairly well stocked. Don&#8217;t feel like you have to go out and spend a small fortune on different spices though, just to make this dish &#8211; you can always make it with a smaller selection. The ras el hanout I&#8217;ve been using is one my sister bought in Morroco, and despite careful rationing I&#8217;m going to have to omit that soon, unless I can source some locally (perhaps online?). As a suggestion for simplifying the spice mix, maybe try paprika, choose one or two of coriander, cumin and tumeric, and add some cinnamon or nutmeg for warmth. With the exception of some occasional ginger bread, I despise ginger, and I also dislike hot/spicy food, but if that&#8217;s not you then ground ginger and cayenne pepper are the sorts of spices which would also work well in this dish.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 170˚C (340F). Combine all spices in a small bowl. Add half the spices to the cooked chickpeas and set aside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Place the dried apricots in a small bowl and add enough hot water to barely cover them. Place the saffron in another small bowl or cup and add 1/4 cup cold water.</p>
<p>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat (if and ONLY IF you have a CAST IRON casserole dish, use this instead of the frying pan. If your casserole dish is ceramic, you will need it later but DO NOT put it on the stove. Yes, possibly an excessive use of caps lock here, but I learned this the hard way.)</p>
<p>Add onion to the frying pan and sauté until soft, but not brown. Add the garlic and spices and cook for another minute or two. Add the chickpeas, tomatoes, dried apricots and their soaking water, flaked almonds, sultanas, saffron in its soaking water, tomato juice, vegetable stock and honey.</p>
<p>Bring to the boil, then transfer to a casserole dish (unless you were already using a cast iron dish). Bake for one hour.</p>
<p>Fry lemon rind in 1 tablespoon olive oil for a few minutes, stopping cooking if the rind starts to brown.</p>
<p>Serve the tagine atop a lettuce leaf, and sprinkle with the cooked lemon rind and chopped coriander to garnish.</p>
<p><a name="morrocanquinoapilaf"></a></p>
<h3>Moroccan&nbsp;quinoa pilaf</h3>
<p>Serves 6-8 as a side</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups quinoa</li>
<li>1/2 cup dried fruit, chopped (I used dates and currants recently; dried apricots also work well but I omit when serving with the chickpea tagine as the tagine already has a lot of apricots in it. If using currants, sultanas, raisins or cranberries, keep these separate from the rest of the fruit.)</li>
<li>1/2 cup nuts, coarsely chopped and toasted (I like a mix of almonds, pine nuts and pistachios, but you could also try macadamias, walnuts, cashews, pecans, hazelnuts or any of your other favourite nuts.)</li>
<li>3 teaspoons spices: a similar mix to that used in the tagine. I typically add a sprinkling of each, using a bit less nutmeg and pepper than everything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat the canola oil in a saucepan over medium heat, then add quinoa and toast for a few minutes. Stir through the spices.</p>
<p>Remove saucepan from the heat for a few minutes so that it cools slightly. Add 2 1/2 cups water and return to the stove. If you add the water without letting the saucepan cool first I find the water and quinoa splatter everywhere, making quite the mess and losing some of your quinoa to the stove/wall/floor/your top or hair. If using currants, sultanas, raisins or cranberries, add these now. Reserve the rest of the dried fruit for later.</p>
<p>Return saucepan to the stove. Bring to the boil then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until water is absorbed and quinoa tender, 15-20 minutes. Add a little more water during cooking if needed. You can tell the quinoa is cooked because the little rings around the outside of the seed will start to separate from the central part.</p>
<p>Stir through remaining dried fruit. Pilaf can be prepared up to here in advance. Sprinkle with nuts just before serving, so that the nuts remain nice and crunchy.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;What&#8217;s for dinner?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>&#8220;Umm, what&#8217;s in the fridge?&#8221;</p>
<p><em></em><em></em><em>&#8220;A selection of random veges, maybe a couple of eggs.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>Sound familiar? In our household this scenario often results in grilled vegetable stacks for dinner. The recipe below is for the version I made last night but you can really play around with the ingredients depending on your tastes and what&#8217;s on hand.</p>
<p>For a quicker option, skip or don&#8217;t salt the eggplant and cut down on the number of different vegetables used. For vegan or dairy/lactose-free versions, omit the eggs &amp;/or fetta as appropriate.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>1 eggplant, sliced into 5-10mm thick rounds</li>
<li>1 sweet potato, cut into 5-10mm thick slices</li>
<li>1 bulb garlic, cloves separated but unpeeled</li>
<li>1 red onion, cut into 12-16 wedges (12 for a medium onion, 16 for a large onion)</li>
<li>250g cherry tomatoes</li>
<li>1 red capsicum, cut in half and seeds removed</li>
<li>1 large or 2 small zucchinis, cut lengthways into 5mm thick slices (not rounds). If the zucchini is large, halve the slices.</li>
<li>100g mushrooms, sliced</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>Dried basil</li>
<li>4 eggs, hard-boiled or poached (instructions for both are below)</li>
<li>A splash of white wine vinegar for cooking the eggs</li>
<li>Balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>2 cups lettuce leaves,&nbsp;coarsely&nbsp;chopped</li>
<li>60g fetta cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is to cook all the vegetables, then it&#8217;s just about arranging it all on plates.</p>
<p><strong>Eggplant:</strong> Sprinkle eggplant with salt and set aside for 30 minutes. Rinse well and pat dry with paper towel. Heat a grill or frying pan over medium heat and thinly coat with olive oil. Add eggplant and grill/fry until golden brown on the underside, about 10 minutes. Flip and repeat until golden on both sides. Remove to drain on a paper towel and repeat with any remaining slices.</p>
<p><strong>Sweet potato, onion &amp; garlic:</strong> Meanwhile, preheat oven to 180˚C (350 F). Brush a baking tray with olive oil and place sweet potato on the tray in a single layer. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and a little dried basil. Arrange red onion and garlic cloves around sweet potato slices. Bake until sweek potato is starting to soften, about 15 minutes. Flip sweet potato slices and return to oven. Continue to bake until sweet potato is cooked through and starting to brown, and garlic and onion are soft.</p>
<p><strong>Capsicum &amp; tomatoes:</strong> Brush another baking tray lightly with olive oil. Place capsicum halves on tray with the skin-side up. Add tomatoes to the tray, and bake at 180˚C until capsicum and tomato skins are blistered. I find this might normally take about 20 minutes, but is closer to 30-40 minutes if the tray is on the lower oven rack (under the sweet potato tray). Rinse the capsicum under cold water until cool enough to handle, then peel skin off and cut the flesh into slices.</p>
<p><strong>Zucchini:</strong>&nbsp;Lightly coat a grill or frying pan with olive oil. Grill or fry zucchini slices over a medium heat until golden on both sides, about 15 minutes total (flip half way). Drain on paper towel.</p>
<p><strong>Mushrooms:</strong>&nbsp;Heat a little olive oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté until golden, about 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>To hard-boil eggs:</strong> Place eggs in a saucepan and add enough cold water to cover completely. Adding a splash of white wine vinegar to the water will help the white set quickly in the event any of the shells crack while cooking, thus avoiding large globules of egg white leaking out. Bring to the boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium and cook for 12 minutes. Allow eggs to cool enough to handle (cold running water helps here). Crack shell on a hard surface, peel and slice or chop.</p>
<p><strong>To poach eggs:</strong> Heat a saucepan of water, with a dash of white wine vinegar added, over a low heat until it is barely simmering. Again, the vinegar will help the egg white set quickly, so your egg doesn&#8217;t end up in threads through the water. You don&#8217;t want the water to be bubbling vigorously or the bubbles will tear the egg apart and you&#8217;ll end up with an unattractive egg broth. Crack one egg into the saucepan, just above the water (not too high or it will break up upon hitting the water). Cook for 3 minutes (I use the timer on my phone). Remove egg with a slotted spoon and allow to drain. Repeat for remaining eggs. You can reuse the water, but I generally fish out any bits of egg white left in the water between eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly:</strong>&nbsp;Spread lettuce leaves on dinner plates. Arrange grilled vegetables in layers to form a stack on each plate, starting with the large flat slices, like the eggplant and sweet potato at the bottom, and distributing rounder vegetables, like the tomatoes and garlic, around the edge of the stack. Top each stack with an egg season with salt and pepper to taste. Finally, crumble fetta over the top, drizzle with a little balsamic vinegar and serve.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not often one for luxurious brunches, partly because I usually wake up starving and want to eat breakfast straight away, and partly because of my weekend morning routine: Saturday mornings it&#8217;s off to the Farmers&#8217; Market, and I do a Sunday morning gym class. Over Easter, however, the Farmers&#8217; Market aren&#8217;t on and my gym&#8217;s not running its usual classes, which has made way for lazy mornings over these somewhat indulgent pancakes.</p>
<p>These pancakes are a good way to use up bananas which have ripened beyond eating fresh.&nbsp;They are thicker than your usual pancakes, more fritter- or muffin-like, which works especially well with the crunchiness of the toasted almonds. The almonds could be toasted, the dry ingredients mixed and toppings prepared the night before to make these really quick in the morning.</p>
<p>      <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bananaalmondcoconutpancakes2editedresized.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Serves 3 generously, or perhaps 4 more respectably! (Makes about 9 8cm-diameter pancakes.)</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup almond meal</li>
<li>1/4 cup coconut flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup plain gluten-free flour*</li>
<li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup ripe bananas, mashed (2 large or 3 small bananas)</li>
<li>2 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
<li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
<li>1 tablespoon amaretti (alternatively you could try substituting 1 &#8211; 2 teaspoons almond essence)</li>
<li>1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted</li>
<li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
<li>Maple syrup or honey, seasonal fruit or other toppings to serve**</li>
</ul>
<p>*I use the brown rice gluten-free flour mix suggested in&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gluten-Free-Baking-Classics-Annalise-Roberts/dp/1572840994%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1572840994">Gluten-Free Baking Classics</a></em>, by Annalise Roberts: 6 parts brown rice flour : 2 parts potato starch : 1 part tapioca starch.</p>
<p>**The pancakes I served up were topped with maple syrup and apple sauce with fresh strawberries in one case, and cinnamon baked pear with strawberry sauce in the other. Recipes for the <a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/30/banana-almond-and-coconut-pancakes#applesauce">apple sauce</a>, <a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/30/banana-almond-and-coconut-pancakes#strawberrysauce">strawberry sauce</a> and <a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/30/banana-almond-and-coconut-pancakes#cinnamonbakedpear">cinnamon baked pear</a> are below.</p>
<p>Optional: preheat oven to a very low heat (60-80˚C or 140-180F); you can use this to keep the first batches of pancakes warm while cooking the rest.</p>
<p>Combine all dry ingredients, except slivered almonds, in a large mixing bowl and mix well. In a separate, smaller bowl, combine wet ingredients except the butter.</p>
<p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until well combined. Stir in the toasted almonds. The batter will be much thicker and stickier than your usual pancake batter, more like a cake mix.</p>
<p>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat and melt a third of the butter in the pan. Add spoonfuls of the batter (roughly 1/3 cup in size) and use the back of a metal spoon to spread out until 1cm thick. Pancakes will be about 8-10cm in diameter. Cook until underside is golden, about 10 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on both sides. Place pancakes on an oven-proof plate or tray, lined with paper towels, and keep warm in the oven while you repeat to cook the remaining batter.</p>
<p>Serve&nbsp;immediately, topped with maple syrup or honey and fresh and/or cooked fruit.</p>
<p><a name="applesauce"></a></p>
<h3>Apple Sauce</h3>
<p>Makes roughly &nbsp;1 1/2 cups, which is about right for the above quantity of pancakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 granny-smith* apples, peeled, cored and chopped into about 1cm pieces</li>
<li>1/2-1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or 1/2 a cinnamon stick</li>
<li>1/4-1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, or 9 whole cloves</li>
<li>1 teaspoon raw sugar (white would also work)</li>
</ul>
<p>*if you happen to have a different variety of apples on hand, go ahead and use them, but omit the sugar. You could also use a similar recipe with pears.</p>
<p>Place apples in a small saucepan and add barely enough boiling water to cover. If using cinnamon stick and whole cloves add these now as well. Simmer until apple is soft and mushy, about 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>Drain apples, and fish out the spices (if added). Mash the apple. Add sugar and ground spices (if using) to taste and you&#8217;re done. This sauce will keep in the fridge for a few days.</p>
<p><a name="strawberrysauce"></a></p>
<h3>Strawberry Sauce</h3>
<p>Makes roughly &nbsp;1 1/2 cups, which is generous for the above quantity of pancakes as this sauce is very strong.</p>
<ul>
<li>500g fresh strawberries*, stems removed, halved</li>
<li>Juice of half a lemon (about 1 &#8211; 1 1/2 tablespoons. You could also try substituting balsamic vinegar, in which case you might want to cut down the sugar)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon caster sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
</ul>
<p>*This recipe will work with most fresh or frozen berries, just adjust the sugar and lemon juice to taste.</p>
<p>Place strawberries in a small saucepan over a medium heat, and toss with sugar and lemon juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until strawberries are soft, about 10-15 minutes. Break the strawberries up a bit if they are large or haven&#8217;t started to disintegrate. Mix in vanilla essence.</p>
<p>Allow to cool slightly before serving. This sauce will keep in the fridge for a few days.</p>
<p><a name="cinnamonbakedpear"></a></p>
<h3>Cinnamon Baked Pear</h3>
<p>Serves 3-4 as a pancake topping, again matching the above quantity of pancakes.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 pears*, cored and cut into thin wedges/slices (about 5mm at their thickest point)</li>
<li>A few pinches cinnamon</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>
<p>*This would also work well with apples or perhaps peaches, but for peaches I&#8217;d double the thickness of the slices.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 180˚C (350 F). Brush a baking tray lightly with olive oil.</p>
<p>Spread pear slices in a single layer on the baking tray, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake until pear is tender, about 15-20 minutes. Very ripe fruit might cook more quickly, slightly under-ripe will take a bit longer.</p></p>

<p>Quinoa was one of my best discoveries following my coeliac diagnosis. If I could start eating gluten tomorrow, quinoa would remain one of my staples. I really like the texture, plus quinoa is a great source of nutrients, especially protein. Quinoa is unusual for being a vegetarian complete protein, in fact it&#8217;s so nutritious the Incas revered quinoa as sacred and used it to sustain their armies.</p>
<p>This quinoa salad is modified from a recipe in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/1000-Gluten-Free-Recipes/dp/B00464EAVG%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00464EAVG">1000 Gluten Free Recipes</a> by Carol Fenster. It is slightly sweet and makes a lovely side or light meal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a nut-free version, omit the hazelnuts.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup quinoa</li>
<li>2 cups vegetable stock</li>
<li>½ cup hazelnuts, coarsely chopped and toasted</li>
<li>2 or 3 shallots/scallions, finely sliced</li>
<li>1 cup red seedless grapes, halved</li>
<li>2 cups coarsely chopped lettuce or mixed greens</li>
<li><a href="http://freshanddelish.com/recipes/2013/3/25/grape-hazelnut-and-quinoa-salad#fruitybalsamic">Fruity balsamic dressing (recipe below)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Cook the quinoa: bring 1½ cups of stock to the boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the quinoa. Cook until quinoa is tender but not mushy, about 15-20 minutes, adding extra stock as needed. I find it generally takes a bit under 2 cups, about 1¾ cups of liquid to cook 1 cup of quinoa. You can tell the quinoa is cooked because the little rings around the outside of the seed will start to separate from the central part. Allow quinoa to cool to room temperature, or chill in the fridge during warmer weather.</p>
<p>While the quinoa is cooking&nbsp;and cooling make the dressing and prepare the other ingredients.</p>
<p>Mix the quinoa with the grapes and shallots. Salad can be prepared up to here in advance and stored in the fridge.</p>
<p>Toss the salad with the dressing. Serve quinoa spooned over the lettuce or greens, and sprinkle hazelnuts over the top.</p>
<p><a name="fruitybalsamic"></a></p>
<p><strong>Fruity balsamic dressing</strong></p>
<p>Makes about ⅔ cup</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>¼ cup orange juice (juice of about ½ an orange)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons strawberry jam</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>1½&nbsp;tablespoons canola oil</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped or minced</li>
<li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
<li>&nbsp;A few pinches salt</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size:14px">Strip the thyme leaves from the stems and discard the stems.&nbsp;Combine all ingredients in a jar and shake to combine. If the jam is not&nbsp;dissolving, try microwaving the dressing (for maybe 15-30 seconds, depending on the power of your microwave) to soften the jam.&nbsp;Alternatively you could zap the jam for 10 seconds before adding it to the other ingredients. Final suggestion&nbsp;is to use a small&nbsp;electric blender instead of a jar for mixing, if you have something suitable.</span></p>

   <div class="entry-content">

      <p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Caponataeditedresized.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This is my take on the caponata recipe in Stephanie Alexander&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Cooks-Companion-Ingredients-Australian/dp/1920989005%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dfredel09-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1920989005" target="_blank">The Cook&#8217;s Companion</a>. The combination of &nbsp;acidity from the vinegar, sweetness from the sugar and the depth of the cocoa results in a really interesting flavour, which some people like more than others. My partner loves it. I think it&#8217;s exciting that I get to use cocoa in a savoury dish!</p>
<p>The tomato sauce can be made in advance and stored in the fridge for a few days, or in the freezer for longer.</p>
</p>
<p>For vegan or nut-free versions, omit the eggs or almonds respectively.</p>
</p>
<p>Serves 5</p>
<ul>
<li>2 large or 3 medium eggplants, chopped into 2cm cubes</li>
<li>1 kg tomatoes</li>
<li>2 onions, one diced and one sliced</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped or crushed</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>6 stalks celery, cut into 1cm pieces</li>
<li>1/4 cup capers, drained</li>
<li>1/3 cup white wine vinegar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons raw sugar plus a little extra (the extra is optional)</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
</ul>
<p>To serve:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 eggs, hardboiled, peeled and chopped (if feeding large appetites, add a couple more eggs)</li>
<li>1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted</li>
<li>1 cup brown rice, cooked</li>
</ul>
<p>Sprinkle the eggplant cubes with salt and set aside to drain for 30 minutes. The salt will draw out bitter liquids from the eggplant, improving the flavour. Alternatively, bring a large pot of water to the boil and cook the eggplant for 5-10 minutes. There&#8217;s a fair bit of debate around about whether this is necessary, and which method is best; I have found eggplant does benefit from some treatment, and either method works well for this recipe.</p>
<p>Make the tomato sauce: Peel, seed and chop tomatoes. The Former Chef blog provides a good set of instructions on <a href="http://www.formerchef.com/2009/08/20/how-to-peel-and-seed-fresh-tomatoes/">How to Peel and Seed Tomatoes</a>.</p>
<p>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat, add the <strong>diced</strong> onion and cook until soft, about 5-10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the tomatoes, bring to the simmer then turn the heat down to low (or you&#8217;ll end up with tomato juice splattered all over your stove top). Cook, stirring&nbsp;occasionally, until sauce has thickened. Taste and add a pinch of sugar if the sauce is tart. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set sauce aside to cool. When the sauce is cool enough, use a blender to puree until smooth.</p>
<p>Returning to the eggplant: rinse the salted eggplant well and pat dry. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a frying pan over high heat. Add half the eggplant and fry until lightly golden brown. Set aside to drain over some paper towel, add another tablespoon or two of oil to the pan and repeat with remaining eggplant.</p>
<p>Bring a saucepan of water to the boil over a medium heat. Add celery and blanch for two minutes then drain.</p>
<p>Heat another tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the <strong>sliced</strong> onion and cook until soft. Add the celery and cook for a minute longer. Next add the capers, vinegar, sugar, cocoa and tomato sauce and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Check the flavour and adjust vinegar, sugar and cocoa to taste. Add the eggplant and cook for a further 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Serve over brown rice, sprinkle with toasted almonds and surround with the hardboiled eggs.</p>

<p>I can never resist buying the golden nugget pumpkins at the Farmers&#8217; Market. Not only &nbsp;is pumpkin wonderful to eat but this particular variety also look adorable, and when cut in half and stuffed make for a gorgeously presented meal.</p>
<p>For vegan, dairy/lactose-free or nut-free versions, omit the fetta or pine nuts&nbsp;respectively.</p>
<p>Serves 4</p>
<ul>
<li>2 golden nugget pumpkins</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>1 bunch silverbeet</li>
<li>1 onion, diced</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
<li>8 sundried tomato halves, drained and chopped</li>
<li>100g fetta cheese, crumbled</li>
<li>1/2 cup fresh herbs, finely chopped (I like using a mix of parsley, mint, basil and chives. You could also substitute a few teaspoons of dry herbs if you don&#8217;t have any fresh.)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons pine nuts, toasted (be careful toasting pine nuts, they burn very easily.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Preheat oven to 180˚C (360 F). Cut the pumpkins in half across the middle (i.e. into &#8216;top&#8217; and &#8216;bottom&#8217; halves), and scoop out the seeds. Brush cut sides with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and place face-down on a baking tray. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until tender.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prepare the silverbeet stuffing: Rinse silverbeet, remove stems and coarsely chop the leaves. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until onion is soft, about 5-10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add silverbeet and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until just wilted.</p>
<p>Transfer silverbeet mixture to a bowl and stir in the sundried tomatoes, fetta, herbs and pine nuts.</p>
<p>Once the pumpkin is cooked, scoop out part of the flesh, leaving a thick enough wall that the pumpkin halves retain their shape and can be filled. Add the scooped out pumpkin to the silverbeet stuffing and combine.</p>
<p>Place pumkin halves in a lightly oiled casserole dish, or on a baking tray. Fill with the silverbeet stuffing and return to the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until heated through.&nbsp;</p></p>

<p>I am very much a creature of habit when it comes to breakfast. Breakfast for me takes one of two forms, almost every day of the year. These smoothies are my warm-weather breakfast. (You&#8217;ll find out what my cold-weather breakfast is when the Canberra weather decides to turn chilly for the year). Don&#8217;t let the apparent monotony fool you, breakfast is one of my favourite meals of the day as it&#8217;s so very yummy!</p>
<p>Serves 2</p>
<ul>
<li>2 bananas, cut into thick slices (unless you&#8217;re using a mango, in which case only use 1 banana)</li>
<li>125-150g silken tofu</li>
<li>4 heaped tablespoons, about 1/2 cup, natural yoghurt</li>
<li>1/2 cup apple juice</li>
</ul>
<p>and one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups frozen rasberries, strawberries or mixed berries; or</li>
<li>1 cup frozen blueberries (substitute dairy or soy milk for the apple juice, I find the blueberries and apple juice a bit too sweet); or</li>
<li>flesh of 1 mango (only use one banana, you may like to try orange or tropical juice instead of apple, also it wont be as chilly as using frozen berries, so add a few&nbsp;ice-blocks&nbsp;as well); or</li>
<li>try your own fruit combinations, or just leave it as a plain banana smoothie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Pour into glasses and enjoy!</p>
